title: Last Session Recap
collapse: open

As the party searches the ruins of Conyberry, they uncover remnants of the town's history, magical artifacts, and Agatha's tragic past through enchanted visions. Meanwhile, Dravik secretly meets with the Black Spider and learns of a grim fate awaiting him. In the Soothsayer's Hollow, Agatha's spirit entrusts Corrin with a crystal ball containing her soul, asking to be laid to rest and hinting that Dravik is in danger.

#### Notes

- Agatha identifies that the party wants to find the Forge, Gundren, and Dravik. 
	- She asks that (in Kragmaw Castle):
	- 1) The party brings her bones to her home, 
	- 2) To seek her tomb to prove that her father loved her still, and to banish her lover's spirit. 
	- 3) If the party brings her to her lover, she can weaken and banish him. She warns that a pact with her that goes unfulfilled does not bode well. 
- Corrin shakes her hand, sealing the pact. Corrin's face flushes pale, his skull grows visible, his hair briefly turns white before returning to its normal hue. Corrin has been cursed with a caveat; if he does not fulfill, he is doomed to a certain fate.
- Agatha marks Sha's map. One shows the position of Kragmaw Castle, then Dravik's location, then Wave Echo Cave. The party decides: Dravik first, then the castle (where Gundren also is and where Agatha's quest can be completed), then Wave Echo Cave.
- A faint scream resonates within the crystal ball. There is the general feeling that if that banshee scream were unleashed, things would not end well for whoever heard it. 
- As the party exits, Corrin asks Soggi and Screet if they want to come along. After some debate, they follow after the party. While they walk, they hear the song of someone walking along. They encounter Volothamp Geddarm, who wears a cloak that billows despite a lack of wind. Most striking is the enormous backpack strapped to his frame. He has a rapier, fresh with blood. Behind him on the forest road is the body of a slain manticore.
- Corrin greets Volo, who invites him into his camp as it has become night. He explains that he was attacked by the manticore, and that he already harvested all the components. However, he tells the party they are free to harvest the meat and the skin. 
- Volo questions what Wendell is, then offers him his book of sketches and asks him to identify some creatures within it. Corrin gathers steaks and flank pieces to bring back. As Zinna and Wendell read, there are familiar monsters. There is a section on forest trolls, owlbears, the manticore, mentions of wargs, ankhegs, giant bores, direwolves, glade cats (cats with trapping abilities, tends to avoid humanoids, specific to the neverwinter woods), Cragstalker lizards (northeastern regions). There are a couple of unique creatures: 
	- Wendell identifies that the first one looks like a canine-type being. 
	- The second one looks like a hyena. Maybe a gnoll but with larger padding. Volo mentions that it has a larger stride and it might not be from here. The creature is from the Feydark, brought in by a cruel group of fey. It is a Krenshar, it has the ability to pull back the skin on its face to reveal its skull.
	- The third is a creature called a Peryton, it is a cross between a stag and an eagle, almost like a hippogriff. It is a magical, demonic-looking creature. He seems to have drawn it as though there is frost in the soil where it has stepped. 
- Wendell asks him where he spotted them. Volo says he did not see them recently around the area, but he saw them multiple times and only just managed to get a sketch. He points on the map, in the lowest part of the river, where it forks out into two paths. 
- Volo explains that when he came across the tracks of the Peryton, it was the only one of its kind, borne of the tears of Selune. He thinks it is a fierce creature, not above eating the odd human. 
- Volo asks Sha and Corrin about their weapons, interested in what they do. Corrin tells him he's a blacksmith and tells him about the Loxodon and Glassstaff. Volo asks Sha about his experience, to which Sha recounts a time where he fought a Kraken. He explains that he was more concerned with what the Kraken was guarding, rather than the monster itself. Volo mentions that his books sold out in Waterdeep. Volo also asks Caiphene, Screet and Soggi about their situations.
- Soggi explains that he and Screet serve Tymora. Volo asks if they have ever encountered any celestial creatures; Soggi hands him a rabbit's foot in response.
- Volo asks the party who is their leader; he asks who is the best to give a gift on his behalf, from Volo to the party. Wendell tells him where he can find them (i.e. ask for the Blackout Brigade back in Phandalin) and gives him the spyglass to aid in his monster hunting. In return, Volo gives him a leather book: Volo's Preliminary Notes to Monster Vulnerabilities. 
- That night, Sha takes watch. The rest of the party gets some sleep.

-------------
- Cut to Dravik. He is still in the small encampment near Old Owl Well. The Black Spider and her forces have left the camp, save for a few to watch Dravik and ensure the ritual goes ahead. She has gone to meet the Red Wizard of Thay, who has been a thorn in her side at the Well.
- She is interested in locating a second entrance and is willing to go about it with force. However, it is not the only way and she is still trying to find the answer through the two Rockseeker brothers she has kidnapped.
- Dravik is in the encampment. He is placed atop a stone altar, bound by enchanted silk cords around his back that shimmer with purple light. He has been stripped of his clothes and armor and his skin is marked with sigils. 
- Dravik thinks about all the things he could have done differently. A slender drow figure comes in with a bowl of water and cloth. Her robes bear the insignia of Lolth, though she seems sad. She asks him what he did to deserve this fate, Dravik says he followed the will of Lolth. She says this is not the treatment he deserved, as she had watched him since he was younger. She is an old friend, and she tells him that this was just for the matron's amusements. She says this is Lady Nezna's attempt to curry favor. 
- Dravik tells Ashini that it is good to see her, but asks her how he can get out. He says any way he can help her will help, he doesn't see himself serving Lolth as a Draugr. Ashini explains that she also wanted to leave and gives him an invisibility enchantment. It would conceal him for an hour; long enough to escape. But if he uses it, he will be hunted relentlessly.
- Dravik says he thinks the Black Spider has lost her way in serving Lolth and is only working for her own ends. Dravik tells Ashini that if she helps him, he will help her escape as well. She agrees and tells him the egg-shaped object needs to be administered internally to hide the magic. Dravik swallows it.
-----
- Volo bids farewell to the camp that morning. As the party heads out to the location where Dravik is held. They get the sense that heading northeast is not a good idea; northwestern side of the cliff or southwestern side might be better. 
- There are cliff walls all around the tower, about 30 feet high. The tower itself looks 30 feet high. The party approaches the tower around the walls, circumventing the need to climb them. They see some monsters from around the corner. Different drow and zombies are fighting to the right - a lot.
- As the party fights some zombies, Dravik takes the invisibility potion and slips out. Ashini asks him to come back for her. A doppleganger general is aware of Dravik's attempt to leave and confronts him. 
- The party fights the horde. Wendell whisks Dravik away as a horse. Zinna blows some stuff up while Caiphene and Sha tank. The party successfully escapes.
