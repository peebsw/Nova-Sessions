The party takes a long rest, narrowly avoiding a fight with gnolls. They continue on their journey and fight some gladecats and a peryton. Sha adopts the peryton's baby as the mother is defeated.

#### Notes
- The party heads forward, through a thicket of traps which they deftly avoid. There is a stone wall that the party spots, upon which there is an interesting picture: There are a group of goblins and among them, a larger one. There is a bugbear rising from a wolf, and behind him a woman with fire coming from his hands and wearing a crown. There are goblins, some kneeling and some in fear. In text: "Hate him."
- Dravik sees runic pictures and Sha interprets the runes as flame-enhancing magic. 
- There are ominous traps, among them are tongues stapled to trees of various creatures and animals. The party fails to notice a well-woven canopy of branches, which holds a set of ropes that hold a pouch of stones. As they step under, it releases them onto part of the party. 
- Corrin has a conversation with Agatha as the party walks along the riverbank. Ahead, there is a hideout that conceals the entrance to Kragmaw Castle. As they approach the hideout, they are hit with the stench of dung. The party comes upon 3 goblins who are squatting over overturned helmets in a small clearing. 
- They say "Klarg wants the warbanners ready, we need more dye, King Kroll is calling." One goblin stabs another, killing them for the "dye." They spot the party and prepare for battle. Caiphene sends one goblin flying, killing him instantly. Dravik kills the other with his chain whip.
- Dravik takes one of the helmets used as a latrine and washes it to keep it. 
- As the party looks into the cave, Sha spots a small hole big enough for a small human to fit through into. Sha hoists Zinna into the wall. The interior is hot; there are warpaint marks on the walls, goblin items, and at the back there is a small wooden cabinet. Inside is a single potion and a horn flask. The signage says: "Grunk's brew. Drink make strong." 
- Zinna finds a book with words in Goblin. She is able to distinguish the following words: Ogre, potion, stolen, shaman, Grunk Blufire, Brughor. 
- Zinna takes a small taste of the potion. Her muscles involuntarily flex and she yells out, as if she turned into a barbarian. She takes a goblin mask and one set of goblin hide armor. She tells the rest of the party about what she saw in the cave. 
- Zinna suggests they go through the path that is not along the river. Wendell hastily agrees, suggesting they avoid the water. Zinna sees two goblins standing guard over a set of three wolves, all chained up. They shoot at her. It's clear that they have been beating these wolves as punishment. 
- Zinna throws a vial of acid at the chains holding the wolves. Corrin tentatively promises to give Dravik some gold. One of the wolves attacks the goblins, killing it instantly. Sha and Zinna do their best to soothe the wolves, successfully freeing them after taming them a bit with some meat offerings. Zinna befriends one of the wolves, who decides to come along. She also takes a wolf mask and puts it on.
- The party walks through the tunnel. Caiphene and Wendell hear someone telling another person to stop throwing skins around, it's messing up the runes.
- Ahead, the party comes across two bridges high up, where goblins are posted up. They are sitting near a rock dam, which seems to be holding back a massive bout of water that they could release on invaders.
- The goblins gossip, suggesting that Klarg is not strong, and uses items to bolster his strength. They suggest that someone else should take him down, and they ought to focus on protecting the hideout. 
-  Zinna charges forward after casting disguise self, charging. Sha stops her before she can go in. She opts to pretend to be a goblin escorting prisoners instead. 
- There is a lever ahead that is meant to release the rocks that stop the water from rushing through. There is a failsafe lever, and a lever to drop the goblins. In addition to the two posted up ahead, there is one goblin directly above. 
- The party is escorted up under the premise of being prisoners. There is a tiny goblin with a pot on his head, and a table leg as a sword. Sir Gorby of the Metal Helm, the Gallant Defender of the lower passage, the paladin of Lady Frondelein.
- He beckons them forward. He says, before they go forward, one of them must jump. Behind him is a set of drawers. He pulls out a potted plant from one of the drawers -- Lady Frondelein. He asks for a duel with one of them, to which Sha steps forward. He asks if he can take his turn first. He says his helmet still bears the smell of last week's onion broth. He says Lady Frondelein gives him his strength. Dravik and Wendell pick up on the fact that there is an awakened shrub. It seems to be speaking to the goblin somehow. 
- Sha "defeats" him, and is given Lady Frondelein as a reward. 
- The party heads past the bridge and towards the sounds of voices. The room holds a table with some food, goblets, crossbow bolts. There are two large goblins sitting at the table. 
- There are amphibian creatures, and an armored chicken inside. They give praise to a goblin named Gobellia, who seems to be in charge of cooking.
- Zinna convinces them that she is Masko, the one in charge of the wolves.  The party manages to sneak past after she drinks some soup, save for Corrin, who fails. The party takes up the guise of being escorted forward again. They reach the two goblins on the bridge.
- Dravik throws the two goblins off of the bridge. The party hurries past, and Zinna throws some greek fire behind them to prevent the goblins behind from going forward. Dravik pulls up the bridge after they cross to prevent people from following.
- As the party rounds the corner, they come across the bugbear named Klarg and a goblin named Ymic (?). The cavern has two pools, and there is a rushing flow of water from further up the mountain. Klarg stands near one of the two pools. 
- Ymic comes out to attack. Zinna convinces him they will take care of Klarg. They try to deceive Klaarg but fail, so he calls for backup.
