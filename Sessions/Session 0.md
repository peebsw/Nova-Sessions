## Starting Prompt:

 ###### Welcome to the Sword Coast, where our adventure begins in the city of Neverwinter – The Jewel of the North.
 The sun of the mid-summer months hangs over the [[Neverwinter|City of Skilled Hands]], its light glints off the polished cobbles from the noble estates and reflects off the clear waters of the [[Neverwinter|Neverwinter]] River, which does not freeze, even in the colder months. Even in the peak of the season, you enjoy the scent of the sea breeze, floating inland from the Sea of Swords, mingling with the perfume of blooming peach trees along the river-gardens and the scent of warm breads from the local bakeries. It is the year 1491 DR, and [[Neverwinter|Neverwinter]] stands proud, despite the scars from the Ruining, the volcanic eruption of Mount Hotenow, the city is one of rebirth, its people have pressed forward, restoring the city under the leadership of [[Lord Dagult Neverember]].

Whether you are a local, or are here for the first time, [[Neverwinter]] is a thriving metropolis known for its bustling trade – Merchant ships from [[Waterdeep]], [[Baldur’s Gate]], and even distant [[Amn]] are sent and received, docking in the city’s harbor, while caravaners spend their days traveling the High Road bringing goods to and from the frontier. There are plenty of noble families to spend coin within the city walls, where blacksmiths, alchemists, and enchanters are happy to ply their trade, producing fine weapons and armor for the masses. The floating candles of [[Cloaktower]], hang high over the city, the central quarters for the members of the [[Many-Starred Cloaks]], the protectorate of mages that spend their days investigating and defending the city from internal and external threats. Scholars from there have spent many a day seeking remnants of old Netherese ruins hidden beneath the streets, making [[Neverwinter]] a center of lore and intrigue. [[Neverwinter]] is a place where fortunes can be made or lost. Whether by coin, blade, or magic, the city rewards those who dare to shape their own fate. Whether you are a veteran warrior seeking your next contract, a scholar chasing legends, or a wanderer caught in fate’s grasp. At differing times over the last weeks, you have been conscripted or called to help by the benefactors of our first quest, [[Gundren Rockseeker]], of Rockseeker Brothers Co. and [[Sildar Hallwinter]], an ex-regiment leader of the Lord’s Alliance.

###### A Mission for Rockseeker Brothers Co. 
At the heart of this job stands [[Gundren Rockseeker]]—a sturdy dwarf, sporting a red woolen hat with a keen eye for opportunity and an eagerness that’s hard to ignore. Either through a connection to him, his brothers [[Tharden Rockseeker|Tharden Rockseeker]] and [[Nundro Rockseeker|Nundro Rockseeker]], or through [[Sildar|Sildar Hallwinter]], the ever-loyal companion, and ex-Lord’s Alliance Regiment Leader, you have joined a group who for coin or for friendship have agreed to help deliver a shipment of mining goods and essentials to the frontier town to the south of [[Phandalin]]. "I ain't gonna lie to ye folks—this ain't just a supply run. There's somethin' big waitin' to be uncovered. My old friend has agreed to hold some of the proprietary mining tools my brothers and I have developed in his warehouses as we prepare for our mining expeditions. I need a reliable team of good sorts to help me get my goods there safely, and on arrival, I’ll pay you all a good round of fifty gold a piece.” There are dangers lurking in the region—bandits and orcs have been spotted along the roads, and rumors whisper of forces moving in the shadows, seeking whatever secrets lie buried beneath the region. Greed, after all, is never in short supply. For now, the job is simple: escort a wagon of supplies to [[Phandalin]]. Fifty gold for safe delivery to his contact, [[Elmar Barthen]], who is securing space in his warehouse. If trust is built, [[Gundren Rockseeker]] promises something greater. Before session zero begins, I want you to consider that no one wisely ventures into the frontier alone. How do each of you know Gundren, Sildar, or each other? What drives you to take this job, and what do you seek in Phandalin?

## Backstory Stuff
#### How does Zinna know Corrin?
Zena learned smithing from Corrin. On the way to Neverwinter, pursuing the map from the journal towards Phandalin, Corrin stopped by Zena's grandfather's shop and they decided to tag along.

## Session Events
- Gundren greets Corrin and Zena as they enter Rockseeker Brothers Co. Corrin is very top-heavy and muscular. He has a warm demeanor about him. Zena is a lady gnome, around 4 feet tall, wearing leather boots and gloves. 
- Sildar steps in, greeted by Gundren. Wendell introduces himself and is quickly approached by Zena, who asks him if he is a water genasi. He states, "I am a lake." She questions how he holds himself together.
- Gundren asks if that's everyone, a new face steps in. Elf that is dressed in jewelry and tattoos steps in. He waves, says a contact told him he needs to be there as they are in need of escorts. His name is Esha, but he asks to be called *Shaw.*
- Corrin asks to see Shaw's blade, inspects shortsword. Wendell asks if it is meant to be a violent expedition, so Sildar points out the map. He pulls up the contract, which offers 50 gold pieces to the mercenaries that do end up helping out to deliver the goods to Phandalin.
- There is a cheer outside the door -- Gundren celebrating the two new arrivals. Dravik and Caiphene arrive. A short elf with pinkish red hair and long cloak on her back enters (Caiphene). She looks irritated at Gundren, like "You didnt tell me all these other people would be here," then goes and sits by herself. Dravik is wearing a suit of studded leather armor and a shield -- a rare dark elf. 
- Gundren trusts Wendell and Corrin, so they are unofficially in charge. The party is shown the two horse drawn carts. They seem to have some mining machinery and tools inside. Exactly what is inside is a bit unclear. There are two horses, a tamed snowy owlbear, and a beautiful golden winged griffon, named Silver Talon. Wendell is given a piece of meat by Sildar and offers it to Sha, and the two go to feed it. It takes the meat with a snap. Sildar tells them that Silver Talon has been his companion for ~25 years.
- Zinna investigates and finds mining equipment, as well as several metal canisters marked with runes of warning. There are several clockwork devices, along with detonators. Gundren clears his throat.
- They meet, separate, spend a night apart. Wendell bunks with Sildar. The next day, Corrin offers to look at people's weapons and armor. Dravik blesses the cart. Corrin and Dravik will be the ones to drive the animals.
- Wendell brings everyone breakfast, then they set off. They hear a story about a location to the South, called the Mere of Dead Men. What they thought were lantern lights were actually will o' the wisps. The cautionary whispers make it clear that remaining vigilant is in your best interest.
- They stop at about the halfway point to make camp. They talk about the specifics of Wendell's race, eat some stew, have a group hug. Dravik does not want the group hug and goes to do his night watch.
- A figure approaches in the night. He holds up a finger to Dravik to motion for "quiet". Dravik tries to pull out his weapon, but the man stops him and offers out a meal. He isn't sure whether it's poisoned or not. A group of druids approaches in the morning, one of whom has a staff with a living vine.  Sha identifies them as druids of Selune, and they seem to be leaving plants and purifying as they walk along the path.
- Morning comes, end session.
