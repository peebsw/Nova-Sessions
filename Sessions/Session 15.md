title: Last Session Recap
collapse: open

The party seals the deal with Agatha, promising to fulfill her requests in exchange for information on several key figures. As the party departs with her spirit in tow, they come across a wandering bard: Volothamp Geddarm, an up-and-coming monster researcher who joins them for the night. He tells them of monsters in the area then leaves them as they head to the Black Spider's camp in search of Dravik. There, they fight off a swarm of drow, spiders, and undead before making off with their invisible friend.

#### Notes

-  The party travels for about a day, headed west, to escape from the Black Spider's camp and to head towards Agatha's castle. The party stumbles along, a good majority of them wounded. Dravik is cut enough that it could be used as a method of tracking. The path drops into a small ravine filled with pine and fog; without a detour down south they will be at the mercy of the high ground.
- Wendell finds a cave with some signs of a medium creature near the entrance. There is a smaller side of the cave, like a burrow. The party enters while Sha stays near the front, keeping watch. The weather, as told by druidcraft, will be mild and pleasant, if not a bit foggy. 
- Dravik is patched up and Wendell lends him his robe. A black ichor starts weeping from his eyes, thick and tarlike. Pale grey web patterns form underneath his eyes where it dries. Wendell casts Detect Poison and Disease, determining that it is neither. It seems to a branding mark. 
- It seems as though Corrin's curse is worsening as well. He sits in discomfort, and Agatha's presence looms over him. Sha determines that Dravik is having a negative reaction to a failed drider transformation. 
- It's around 4 am, Caiphene hears a sound from a creature outside. Caiphene shakes Wendell awake, and he goes to investigate the cave mouth. It seems to be a half rotten leg of a goat. Gnolls descend upon the camp. Wendell persuades them that the scent of blood is from a wounded animal passing by in the opposite direction. The gnolls, skeptical, decide they will eat Wendell even though he tries to persuade them he is only filled with water. They escort him away, to which he wild shapes into an elk to escape with the aid of a well-placed fog cloud by Caiphene. 
- Wendell leads them away, then wild shapes into a spider to hide from them. He returns to camp and the party completes their long rest uninterrupted.
- In the morning, Sha gives Dravik a weapon to defend himself with. Caiphene goes out to hunt. Dravik tells Corrin he will talk about what happened later. Corrin says he was afflicted with a curse by the banshee, who showed up in his dream last night. She tapped her wrist, indicating there was a time limit to their promises.
- Caiphene brings back some small game as the party agrees to make their way to the castle. As the party stops to rest, they are ambushed by Gladecats and a Peryton. Gladecats are primarily stalking predators, which typically ensnare unwary adventurers. 
- The party fights and kills the Gladecats. Wendell tries to persuade the Peryton to let them go, as she says she is trying to protect her child. She does not believe him, so the party fights her to the death. Sha delivers the killing blow with an arcane lance. 
- Wendell finds the baby Peryton, who asks for his mother. He tells her she is away, so the baby approaches the party and asks Sha if he's his father. Wendell suggests he is, for now, so Sha takes him under his wing and adopts him. The topic of the mom is sidestepped, for now. Wendell feels guilty for being unable to persuade the mother. 
- Sha names the baby, "Azuryth".
