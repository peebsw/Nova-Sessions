### Notes

- The party sits to have a drink, promising to clean up after. [[Corrin]] and [[Zinna]] set about repairing the broken door. [[Toblen Stonehill|Toblen]], [[Corrin]], and [[Caiphene]] head off to dispose of the corpses. The corpses are thrown into the fireplace, and the party goes to rest for the night. [[Zinna]] and [[Wendell]] get to work about cleaning after [[Wendell]] sees that the expenses for repairing the inn are in excess of 1000 gp.
- [[Corrin]] and [[Dravik]] discuss their next steps on the balcony. [[Dravik]] recommends sending a scout to examine the situation before they make any further moves.
- As the party settles in for the night, [[Dravik]] sees a spider with purple dots skittering by. [[Zinna]] examines [[Caiphene]]'s puzzle box. The party, save for [[Esha|Sha]], head to their rooms. On the roof, [[Dravik]] hears the spider communicating telepathically with him. It tells him to make them forget about [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]], and when the time comes she will take care of the rest.
- In the morning, [[Toblen Stonehill|Toblen]] talks about how the inn is a family business. He mentions Hallia in a positive way, implicitly giving his support for her as a replacement. [[Toblen Stonehill|Toblen]] hands over a wrapped up sword in an oilcloth that has some faded markings on it. It seems to have been used by a noble family in some sort of rebellion. It was the only thing left to [[Toblen Stonehill|Toblen]] besides the farm's debts. [[Wendell]] and [[Zinna]] come downstairs after [[Wendell]] does some yoga.
- [[Elmar Barthen|Elmar]] arrives and the party lets him in. He tells them that [[Halia Thornton|Hallia]] is rallying the miners tonight to fight. The party goes to the town alchemist, [[Grelka Thistlewood]], who has the following for sale:
	- **Potion of Healing** — **75 gp each (3 left)**
	- **Holy Water Flask** — **50 gp**
	- **Blessing Amulet** — **40 gp donation**
	- **Potion of Sanctuary** (Advantage on stealth checks, lasts 1 hour — 2 left) — **100 gp**
	- **Comprehend Languages Scroll - 50 gp**
	- **Find Familiar Scroll - 100 gp** 
- [[Wendell]] buys the amulet, which [[Zinna]] finds out is for Lathander. [[Zinna]] buys the Find Familiar Scroll. [[Caiphene]] buys the *Comprehend Languages*. The potion of healing is also bought by multiple members.
- [[Zinna]] and [[Dravik]] go off to scout the area after [[Zinna]] casts *Find Familiar* and summons an owl, and casts disguise self to look like a circus performer. 
	- [[Zinna]] enters the inn under the guise of looking for lodging. By this point, it's late afternoon. In the [[Grista Kettlecopp|Sleeping Giant Inn]], she sees a substantial group of people of assorted races: kenku, orcs, loxodon, bugbear, etc.
	- [[Zinna]] sees the man known as [[Vraxen de Vrait|Vraxen]] who seems to be signing some sort of contract with a nobleman. She identifies the nobleman as the most dangerous man in the room.
	- [[Dravik]] finds the trade agreement between [[Vraxen de Vrait|Vraxen]] and the nobleman:
			- TRADE AGREEMENT

- [[Sildar Hallwinter|Sildar]], [[Daran Edermath|Daran]], [[Halia Thornton|Halia]], [[Qelline Alderleaf|Qelline]], and an [[Sister Garael|unknown woman]] are having a meeting at [[Toblen Stonehill|Stonehill Inn]]. [[Esha|Sha]] goes in to investigate, [[Caiphene]], [[Corrin]], and [[Wendell]] stay behind.
	- He overhears that [[Qelline Alderleaf|Qelline]] has found someone of importance, there is a group of around 30 miners ready for battle and they've made contact with the general on his way to Neverwinter, and there is unrest in another area.
- [[Caiphene]] and [[Corrin]] are beckoned over by [[Qelline Alderleaf|Qelline]]'s children, who claim they are the [[Thistle Alderleaf|Secret Squirrels]] and they have information on how to enter the manor. [[Corrin]] pledges to become a [[Thistle Alderleaf|Secret Squirrel]] but is rejected, and the two initiate [[Esha|Sha]] into their group.
- The party are led by the kids to the ghost door in the manor. [[Esha|Sha]] figures out that [[Everard Vandemere]] was the previous [[Harbin Wester|townmaster]], who [[Harbin Wester|Harbin]] had previously dismissed as useless. Yet he is negotiating with the [[Redbrand|Redbrands]] to escort something to his property in Neverwinter.
- As they pass by fox dens, [[Thistle Alderleaf|Thistle]] explains that her father, who was a hunter, used to leave a silver coin to buy the foxes' silence. She uses the coin [[Esha|Sha]] gave her earlier to leave by the dens.
