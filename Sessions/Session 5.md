### Notes

- The party sits to have a drink, promising to clean up after. Corrin and Zinna set about repairing the broken door. Toblin, Corrin, and Caiphene head off to dispose of the corpses. The corpses are thrown into the fireplace, and the party goes to rest for the night. Zinna and Wendell get to work about cleaning after Wendell sees that the expenses for repairing the inn are in excess of 1000 gp.
- Corrin and Dravik discuss their next steps on the balcony. Dravik recommends sending a scout to examine the situation before they make any further moves.
- As the party settles in for the night, Dravik sees a spider with purple dots skittering by. Zinna examines Caiphene's puzzle box. The party, save for Sha, head to their rooms. On the roof, Dravik hears the spider communicating telepathically with him. It tells him to make them forget about Gundren, and when the time comes she will take care of the rest.
- In the morning, Toblin talks about how the inn is a family business. He mentions Hallia in a positive way, implicitly giving his support for her as a replacement. Toblin hands over a wrapped up sword in an oilcloth that has some faded markings on it. It seems to have been used by a noble family in some sort of rebellion. It was the only thing left to Toblin besides the farm's debts. Wendell and Zinna come downstairs after Wendell does some yoga.
- Elmar Barthen arrives and the party lets him in. He tells them that Hallia is rallying the miners tonight to fight. The party goes to the town alchemist, Grelka Thistlewood, who has the following for sale:
	- **Potion of Healing** — **75 gp each (3 left)**
	- **Holy Water Flask** — **50 gp**
	- **Blessing Amulet** — **40 gp donation**
	- **Potion of Sanctuary** (Advantage on stealth checks, lasts 1 hour — 2 left) — **100 gp**
	- **Comprehend Languages Scroll - 50 gp**
	- **Find Familiar Scroll - 100 gp** 
- Wendell buys the amulet, which Zinna finds out is for Lathander. Zinna buys the Find Familiar Scroll. Caiphene buys the Comprehend Languages. The potion of healing is also bought by multiple members.
- Zinna and Dravik go off to scout the area after Zinna casts Find Familiar and summons an owl, and casts disguise self to look like a circus performer. 
	- Zinna enters the inn under the guise of looking for lodging. By this point, it's late afternoon. In the Sleeping Giant Inn, she sees a substantial group of people of assorted races: kenku, orcs, loxodon, bugbear, etc.
	- Zinna sees the man known as Vraxen who seems to be signing some sort of contract with a nobleman. She identifies the nobleman as the most dangerous man in the room.
	- Dravik finds the trade agreement between Vraxen and the nobleman:
			- TRADE AGREEMENT
				This pact, forged on the twelfth of Everstead, binds:
				Vraxen de Vrait, (REDACTED) and Everard Vandemere, (VANDEMERE FAMILY).
				Services: Escort service to be provided by Vraxen’s operation.
				(REDACTED) Location where Redbrands will offer security.
				Discreet logistics by Everard will be offered through messenger birds.
				Delivery of (REDACTED) to be made by the eighteenth of Everstead.
				Terms are sworn to  absolute secrecy. 
				Two signatures are made out below.
- Sildar, Darren, Hallia, Qelline, and an unknown woman are having a meeting at Stonehill Inn. Sha goes in to investigate, Caiphene, Corrin, and Wendell stay behind.
	- He overhears that Qelline has found someone of importance, there is a group of around 30 miners ready for battle and they've made contact with the general on his way to Neverwinter, and there is unrest in another area.
- Caiphene and Corrin are beckoned over by Qelline's children, who claim they are the Secret Squirrels and they have information on how to enter the manor. Corrin pledges to become a Secret Squirrel but is rejected, and the two initiate Sha into their group.
- The party are led by the kids to the ghost door in the manor. Sha figures out that Vandemere was the previous townmaster, who Harbin had previously dismissed as useless. Yet he is negotiating with the Redbrands to escort something to his property in Neverwinter.
- As they pass by fox dens, Thistle explains that her father, who was a hunter, used to leave a silver coin to buy the foxes' silence. She uses the coin Sha gave her earlier to leave by the dens.
