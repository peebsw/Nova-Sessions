### Notes

- Gundren tells us that there have been 3 ambushes in 2 days - the goblins and the Redbrands (2x).
- Zinna heals up the horse. The party checks to make sure no-one is injured before we get going again. Dravik is given a healing potion to drink. Zinna heals up Sha and the horse. Wendell and Zinna stack some stones on the horse.
	- Zinna skins **3 pieces of troll's hide**, **12 teeth**, and **9 claws**.
	- Zinna siphons **3 vials of troll's blood.**
	- Wendell gives Dravik his **sling.**
- Zinna finds a piece of parchment on one of the goblins. In large letters it reads:
> 	 =="Capcher de Dorf, Klarg."== 
- The group makes camp and has a long rest before we head off to Phandalin. We arrive; it's a very small town. There's a lazy patrol of volunteer guards. Many of the town's residents are at their home, at the town's fields, etc. Streets are pretty quiet and assuming -- a stark contrast to Neverwinter.
- We make our way to **Barthen's Provisions**. Shelves are lined with goods for travelers and traders. There is a space in the back for the warehouse. On the front of the shop is a note that says "Closed for the Weekend, open at sunrise tomorrow."
- Zinna calls out, Sha tries to knock. No response to either. Wendell suggests leaving the cart there, as the town seems trustworthy. Sha states they will sit with the wagon on their own, but if the rest of the party doesn't come back, they will take all the money.
- Dravik and Wendell go off to **Stonehill Inn** for the night. Wendell tells Dravik he should tell him all about his homeland. It's a mellow inn with a nice fire and people talking. There's roasted meat and spiced wine. There's a man offering a friendly smile to newcomers. In the corner of the room there's a bard playing a lute, and a semicircle of farmers discussing the state of affairs. 
- ==**Toblin Stonehill**== is the name of the owner. Wendell drops the coins on the counter -- people seem to be sizing him up. He turns and waves; that, with Dravik's weapons also being set on the counter, seems to shift their attitudes. They order some ale. Wendell tells them they're there for exploration/tourism, Dravik agrees and cuts him short before he talks about the wagon.
- Back at the wagon, Zinna is telling the party about not having eyebrows through a series of unfortunate events. ==**Elmar Barthen**== arrives and tells them that Gundren has not arrived yet. The party tells him about the goblin ambush and he seems to be surprised. They tell him that the goblins seemed to be interested only in Gundren, not the items.
- The party is led to the back of the store. Sha and Corrin each take a wagon to the back. The party tells Barthen about the goblin/troll & bandit ambush. He leads them to the front and pulls out the money for the group. Zinna inquires about a workbench. Barthen suggests going to the **==Miner's Exchange==**, just down the road, which has a smithy attached to it. He tries to give them 50 for the four, but Zinna goes to get Dravik and Wendell.
- Toblin tells Wendell and Dravik that there has been an infestation of bad types, primarily in the western side. He mentions the Redbrands and how Wester, the townmaster, hasn't done anything about it. He also tells Dravik that they have been paying for protection. Wendell says he'll gladly talk to the townmaster.
- A woman with long, red hair comes out carrying meat. Her name is Trilena Stonehill (Elsa) and she calls Toblin "love". Toblin explains that it's unclear who leads the Redbrands, which makes them difficult to deal with. Wendell suggests talking to them to appeal to their good nature. Dravik says he'd come along, but Wendell tells him he wouldn't want him to get hurt. Zinna comes in then and tells them about the money. Wendell offers Zinna some ale, takes the rest of it for the group. Dravik tells the barkeep they'll be back.
- Wendell hears two ladies gossiping with looks of concern on the way out. They seem to be talking about the Redbrands and a woman. Her surname is Alderleaf. She's some kind of widow who lives on a farm in the countryside and the two women are talking about how one of the Redbrand chiefs are talking about how he'd burn the farm down that very night, and she has children to boot.
- Wendell follows the two, perturbed, and tells them they will have to have a conversation. The trio returns to the main group through the back. Elmar was speaking to Corrin primarily during their absence, asking about their plan. Corrin mentions he plans on staying to work with Gundren for a while.
- Elmar asks Sha about their plan. Sha tells them he plans on finding another job. He asks them if they're actively looking for work and mentions there is a board full of odd jobs for poeple to pick up. There are also more "adventurous jobs" on the board for people to pick up. 
- Elmar asks Caiphene for her plans. She says she plans on returning to Neverwinter to get the odd job. She says once they meet with Gundren she's gonna start making her way back.
- Zinna returns with Wendell and Dravik. The entire party gets **50 gp** each. Wendell tells the party about the fire at the farm he overheard. Elmar tells him the farm belongs to Qelline Alderleaf. Zinna dumps water on Wendell to test a theory and finds it slides right off.
- We arrived at around midday. It's been a couple of hours, so it's around 3:30 pm. Elmar points the party to the farm on a rudimentary map, which he hands to Sha. Sha mentions that they came from a boat, and Wendell tries to get him to talk about it. When they don't, Zinna offers to talk about how she burnt her eyebrows off.
- The party sees the halfling woman, Qelline Alderleaf, and her kids Thistle (daughter) and Carp (son) as they arrive to the small farm. Caiphene and Corrin tell the family that there will be a fire. Wendell tells them he overheard some women talking about burning the farm down. Qelline says she knew this would happen but didn't think it would happen that night. 
- Qelline explains that she speaks out against the Redbrands. She used to run a news column called the Phandalin Daily, where she spoke out against the Crimson Marauder. Qelline runs off then returns and asks them how good they are in a fight. Zinna tells her that Sha is very good, particularly against people in trees.
- Caiphene goes to guard the back. Wendell and Qelline go on the roof. Zinna is in the fields setting decoys around the house + the field. The rest are keeping watch at the top of the hill overlooking the field.
- Dravik is the one to notice an attacker making their way through the fields. Zinna doesn't hear him coming and is the first to be attacked.
- The party fights off the attackers with minimal damage. A few crops are set on fire, and Zinna gets stabbed, but the group comes out largely unscathed.
