title: Last Session Recap
collapse: open

The party navigates a series of traps and strange goblin warnings before reaching a hidden entrance to Kragmaw Castle. They encounter and fight goblins, explore a hot cavern with warpaint and potions, and Zinna gains a goblin disguise and a wolf companion. After taming wolves and hearing goblin gossip about Klaarg’s weakness, the group pretends to be prisoners to infiltrate further. They meet a delusional goblin knight, win a mock duel, and continue deeper into the hideout. Disguises and deception let them bypass several guards until Dravik kills two goblins on a bridge and the group cuts off pursuit. At last, they confront [[Klarg]] and another goblin named Ymic, but their attempt to deceive [[Klarg]] fails and he calls for reinforcements.

#### Notes

- Sha rushes in to fight Klarg, as Ymic eggs the party on, calling Klarg a "terrible boss." Klarg is attacked, and calls for Ymelg, who is wearing a crown of flame magic. She prepares it at his request. 
- The party attacks. Ymelg casts a spell; as magic sparks, she suddenly vanishes, then falls from a very high place and falls prone.
- Ymic, seeing the tides turning, runs in with what Caiphene spots to be a bomb. He lobs it, killing Ymelg. Corrin smashes Klarg to death with the hammer, then apologizes to the worg. 
- Wendell convinces the worg to stand down. The party spots Klarg's room, which is the way to the castle. Dravik takes the circlet from Ymelg's head. 
	- He determines that it gives him an expendable, 1/day charge of burning hands. 
- Corrin spots a fish person rising from the water. Wendell bids everyone to step away from the water, so the party leaves it be and heads to a smaller chamber. They come upon the room with several items:
	- - wooden shield (dravik),
	- potion of greater healing (sha),
	- shortbow + 2 arrows of faerie fire (sha),
	- map from cave to ruined town in forest called Thundertree. Scrawled: “Dormant power lies beneath the ash.” (Corrin),
	- Torn ledger in Goblin. Records of loot sent into Kragmaw. Mention of ring tied to sky lord deep in castle, too dangerous for goblins to approach. Set of blueprints for “Whisper Shroud Plate” stealth heavy armor set for Black Spider.,
	- One strange object, obsidian disc with engraved eye on it. Sha deciphers that eye located on it is located in 4 places around portal. (Wendell)
- The party goes through the portal after testing the eye disc. It seems to shut the portal. When they emerge, it is in a woods with white trees with white towers in the distance. There is a haze with a faint glow through the trees but no visible sunlight. The air crackles with magical static. Sha tells the group that they have stepped onto another plane entirely. 
- Dravik raises the concern that no-one is watching the portal on the other side.
- Wendell observes that the portal closed behind them. then leads the way forward. As they get up the stairs, they sense an intense fatigue overcoming them. They hear murmurs ahead.
- Zinna sends forward her owls to scout the area. She tells the party there are 4 archers, two on each side, if they show themselves. Zinna sends two owls to distract them while the rest of the party tries to stealthily run past. Zinna makes it -- the rest of the party notices the party.
- One of the goblin archers takes out Zinna's owl familiar. Dravik runs past and sees that there are back entrances to each of the towers. The party sneaks to the back, behind the towers to ambush them. Dravik and Sha listen in to a broken wall, where they hear sounds of a canteen. 
- The party fights the four goblins successfully, avoiding them alerting the larger goblin horde in the canteen. Sha finds a tripwire near the front door, alerting the rest of the party. Dravik investigates one of the towers after a scuffle. He finds:
	- A moldy banner with a crude drawing of the goblin deity, Maglubiyet, who is holding up a chicken like a holy symbol. Underneath, someone has scrawled: Do not disturb the holy room! Especially no elves! 
	- A note to get food inspectors from Neverwinter to come and check out their kitchen. There is a checklist for the inspectors to look through, one of which is to check to poison-proof the food for the king.
	- Some shoes that were stolen from the Lord's Alliance footsoldiers.
	- Some of the crates are stolen from merchants from the Tribar region, or Neverwinter. Vinegar leaks from one of them. 
		- A bottle of dwarven ale.
		- A pouch of 66 gp. 
		- Large pickling jar with a creature inside.
- Sha listens in through the front door.  The party then steps through the threshold into a completely dark area, which seems to only have light through small windows. It is filled with magical darkness. 
- Sha feels their way forward. They see statues of Oghma, Lathander, Mystra and Tymora. There are 3 goblins kneeling at an altar; there is a leader. They are doing a grotesque mimicry of a human rite. 
- Sha locates a button that triggers a slight creaking sound beneath them. There is a carpet, which seems to be covering something on an altar. Sha finds a set of stairs headed downwards, into something that seems to be a basement. 
- A monster emerges, and someone hanging from the rafters tells them: "You should not have come here. It is time for her to feed."
- The party distracts the monster with a stone tossed away from them, allowing them to hurry downstairs.
- There is a massive space beneath carved out of stone. It seems like a place to hunker down for the worst times of the castle. There are things with ancient elven motifs, from the previous inhabitants of the castle. 
- The location seems to make Agatha sad, as she was outcast from the area for using dark magic she never actually used. The party heads down a hallway and finds a chamber filled with old silverware. There is one place setting that is perfectly preserved at the end of the table. The room does not have any sign of recent goblin activity.
- Sha tosses a fork at it. Caiphene is able to read a small plaque on the wall, written in Elvish. It says: "To serve in silence is the greatest joy one can experience." 
- There is an abjuration ward coded for more fey-blooded, or those with kinder intent. Goblins and similar creatures would avoid this room; they would feel a deep unease as they approach the threshold. Agatha seems annoyed by their presence in the room. Corrin asks Agatha to give context for her feelings.
- The wisps appear and Agatha says, "You wouldn't find anything in here because these are the servant quarters." 
- The party takes a short rest.
- They hear Gundren in a room in the corner. When they enter, he is in a cell with scratches on the stone wall behind him. His beard is patchy from stress. 
- Gundren's brother, Tharden, lies in the other cell. Wendell freezes the lock, Corrin smashes it open. He gets healed up, then Zinna lockpicks the other door. The party smashes it down.
