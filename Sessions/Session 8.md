title: Last Session Recap
collapse: open

The party rescues **Yvette** and her children, guiding them to safety with **Jonah**, a former prisoner, who reveals that **Glasstaff** was once a Lord's Alliance wizard named **Iarno** and warns them of his cunning. **Dravik** senses an ominous aberration nearby. The group explores further, discovering an old mining operation, a hidden armory, and financial records exposing the **Redbrands'** exploitation of the **Tresendar** mines.

While investigating a hidden notebook, **Zinna** and **Dravik** hear a telepathic voice that despises Glasstaff. The entity, **Ixal**, a **Nothic**, reveals itself, hurling a terrified **Redbrand** toward them. It claims Glasstaff disturbed the crypts, awakening the undead. The Nothic probes the party's feelings about the bandit’s fate before inviting them deeper into the caves.

Crossing treacherous bridges over an abyss leading to the **Underdark**, **Zinna** recovers a chest labeled **"Property of Lord Talemar Tresendar."** **Ixal** offers the group shelter, but when asked for protection, it gruesomely drains the life from the captured **Redbrand**. Shaken, the party takes a long rest, uncertain about their alliance with the creature.
```

#### Notes
- [[Dravik]], [[Esha]], and [[Caiphene]] take turns taking watch as the party rests. [[Corrin]], [[Wendell]], and [[Zinna]] are the ones to rest, albeit fitfully (though maybe not so much [[Zinna]].)
- [[Ixal]] mentions something about the [[Redbrand]] "missing the demise of their master." [[Esha]] and [[Corrin]] question him, but [[Ixal]] is evasive. [[Ixal]] calls [[Dravik]] "son of the Spider Queen." [[Wendell]] asks who the Spider Queen is, and [[Dravik]] tells him it's Lolth, and that he follows her. [[Wendell]] cheers that they both follow a god, while [[Ixal]] calls them foolish for trusting someone who follows Lolth.
- [[Ixal]] sends them off, but not before [[Esha]] feels a stronger tug on his mind. [[Ixal]] tells them, "She is searching for you, you know." The party leaves with more questions than answers.
- There are two doors, one with voices behind it, and one that is silent. [[Esha]] tests the doorknob, and it seems to open easily. [[Dravik]] listens at the door of the other room and hears a group talking about dragon chess.
- [[Dravik]] sarcastically suggests [[Wendell]] go in to challenge them to dragon chess, then waves him off when he takes him seriously. [[Dravik]] kicks the door open and the party runs in to fight the group.
- [[Dravik]] smashes one of them with a door, then is smashed back in retaliation. [[Corrin]] is downed but saved by [[Zinna]]. [[Wendell]] destroys the [[Redbrand]] who hurt [[Corrin]] while he was downed. 
- [[Corrin]] finds a war hammer. The party approaches a door and [[Esha]] and [[Dravik]] hear NSFW activity on the other side. They try to get [[Wendell]] to open the door but it's locked, so he calls [[Zinna]] over. [[Zinna]] tells him he shouldn't go over there, so they pivot to the other, quiet door.
- Entering, the group sees a wizard surrounded by heavy, chemical scents. His back is turned and he is working on something. [[Esha]], [[Corrin]], and [[Dravik]] try to sneak up on the wizard. He does, indeed, have a glass staff. [[Esha]] tries to attack, but it's an illusion.  [[Wendell]] casts detect magic and finds a fake section of the wall.  He also finds a note implying that Glass-staff has been experimenting
- The note also mentions that the Black Spider seems to be looking for a relic, and that the Old Owl Well is a location of interest.
- The group enters the room hidden by the false stone wall. There is a ritual circle in the center, and sparse decorations. A sudden blast of arcane energy, then the temperature drops. At the center is Glass-Staff, his robes frayed and his staff glowing. Beneath him is a runic circle. 
- [[Esha]] tries to discern whether he recognizes the circle. He remembers Coldstone chambers where there were many circles like this one. [[Esha]] remembers some things (in private), and looks very visibly unhappy. He tells the group that they ought to get [[Glassstaff]] out of the circle. There are five clones and 18 runes on the circle. Each time he cast a spell, one of the runes would go dark and a different effect was triggered.
- The party takes a big thunderwave to the face and are scattered. [[Wendell]] points out which Glass-Staff is the illusory one and tries to shoot him with his crossbow to mark him, but the arrow becomes lodged in a glass-like sphere of abjuration(?) magic. The party realize they have to break the sphere first. [[Zinna]] blows a huge chunk of the glass barrier off.
- Half of the party gets swapped in terms of their positions -- half are in the barrier, half are out. A wild magic surge fills the room. One of Glass-staff's spells trigger the wild magic surge and [[Corrin]] is rained on by black coffee.
- [[Wendell]] is downed by an effect that casts "toll the dead" from any magic items. The party is encased in funhouse mirrors.
- [[Dravik]] breaks out, along with [[Caiphene]] and [[Esha]]. A mirror forms above [[Esha]] and rains down glass, knocking him out. Clones form of [[Dravik]] and surround him.
- [[Corrin]] brings out his maul and in one deft smash, breaks the glass barrier and smashes [[Glasstaff]] in one blow. The wizard is defeated.
- In the aftermath, [[Esha]] and [[Wendell]] are brought back up. The group examines the room.

*Zalto. My spies in Neverwinter tell me that strangers are due to arrive in Phandalin. They could be working for the Rockseeker brother. Capture them if you can, kill them if you must, but don't allow them to upset our plans. See to them, I will see to the dwarf...*

title: Diary Entry Found in Glass-Staff's Chambers

*The Black Spider’s promises have turned into chains, binding me to her will. What began as an opportunity to alleviate my curse now feels like a trap. Her gifts, once tokens of generosity, now weigh heavy with the burden of her expectations. I am no longer a trusted ally, but a pawn in her relentless pursuit of power. Her commands grow more forceful by the day, and I fear my fate is inexorably tied to hers. I must tread carefully, but I believe it is time to reassess my loyalties before it is too late.*
```

- There is a number of items in the chest, along with a half-rotted body. It has a look of frozen horror. His left hand is clutching at his chest, his right hand is reaching for something.
- When the group looks at the body of the wizard, there is now a drow doppelganger in its stead.

*To those who seek the castle lost to time. Listen closely to the whispers of the ancient woods. Seek the counsel of the descendants of Auglatha. For within their lineage lies the key to the castle's hidden path. The legacy lives on in the veil.*

title: Letter Found in Glass-Staff's Chambers

*“To the ashes of the fox, I have done what was written in my blood to do. The fire took the house as I had hoped, and the noble lord with it. I did not stay to watch him die. I did not need to. He had burned long before the flames ever touched his skin. I thought perhaps when it was done, I would feel something like sorrow. A grief for the place that, for all its sins, still once held me. I do not. A wound festers when it is left unclean, and Tresendar Manor has been a sickness upon this land for too long. Now, there is only ruin, as there should be. I will not linger to see what becomes of Phandalin in the wake of its loss. There will be no place for me here. Already, the whispers are shifting, the weight of judgment creeping in. The people may have suffered under the hands of noblemen, but they still love their gilded houses. They still prefer their monsters to wear crowns. I leave before the sun rises. There is a ship waiting at the Western coast, and by tomorrow, I will be far from here. If the gods have their way, I will be sent to the hells for what I have done. But I have made my peace with damnation. She is waiting for me there. I go to her with a clean conscience. I go with her name in my heart."*
