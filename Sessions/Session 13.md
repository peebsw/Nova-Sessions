title: Last Session Recap
collapse: open

The party scouted the ruins of Conyberry, identifying key locations and encountering a group of orc raiders led by a shaman, sparking a fierce battle that left several members unconscious but victorious. After finding a corpse in the well and clues pointing to the orcs' main camp, the group met two kobold followers of Tymora, learned of a grumpy kobold scholar named Vrizrak in the watchtower, and fished unusual creatures from the lake—including one that gave Wendell a vision of Conyberry’s brutal destruction by raiders known as the Uthgard. Deeply shaken, the party pieced together that the tragedy may have led to Agatha’s transformation into a banshee.

#### Notes

- Dravik's absence is commented on by Corrin. He says his mission might have not aligned with theirs; Wendell hopes he's doing well, and if he's away, they might have to look for him. Zinna is not too worried, she thinks he's probably fine, as Dravik is very self-sufficient. 
- The group rests, with the exception of Wendell, who buries the townmaster's body. The party awakens to a dense fog clinging to the remnants of the scorched earth. The two kobolds lead a prayer to Tymora, then Corrin and Zinna gather some fruits for breakfast. 
-  Corrin goes and hunts for rabbits. He gives some rabbits feet to Soggi. Zinna makes one pair of earplugs with some tree resin.
- The party decides to look through the buildings for a bit more information. Zinna sends Dinna into the chapel to look through and finds a scene of devastation, of skeletons huddled inside seeking sanctuary. She sees a set of bones at the altar - a cleric of some sort. At the front in the stone there is an elvish inscription. Everything else has been charred beyond recognition. "Here we find solace in the light of Lathander, bringer of light and hope."
	- Under one of the stone benches, there is a stone carving where all of the holy books are placed under the pews. Zinna finds one that seems interesting, an archivist's recollection of the town's history. She learns that there are survivors of the town who escaped to live in other regions. The current year is 1491 DR (Dale Reckoning).
- Back with the others, Soggi and Screet try to sell the rabbit's feet. Initially they scam Wendell out of 50 gp, which turns into nearly 70 gp. They eventually give him back his money, though he gets to keep the rabbit's foot. They then head into the inn, which was once upon a time called "The Crackling Hearth."
- Soggi and Screet have a small hideout with their belongings inside the inn. Screet hides a journal in the corner, behind some wine barrels. The pair lead Caiphene, Corrin and Wendell to another house and tells them that three houses are the ones with the least damage to them. Maybe looking inside will help them. 
- Wendell and Caiphene are lead to the Naster Family Smokehouse, renowned smokers in the region who seasoned and smoked meat, therefore giving them some contingencies against fire in that place. They find two very fancy looking cigars, one named Dragonbreath, the other Elderwoods essence. There are a collection of keepsakes and belongings, along with a partially open envelope. 
	- Reading through it, it seems like it belonged to the lady of the family. It was a psychic reading from the town soothsayer. It talks about the fortunes of her family, and how they will be doing well, but to be mindful of dangers that threaten the community.  
	- Caiphene tries to explain what cigars are to Wendell. Wendell, confused, suggests they hand them to Zinna later.

- Dravik crests a small ridge off the path away from Conyberry. He had taken a small detour away from the march towards town, not too far. He knew, by the orders of the one he serves, he needed to make a slight disappearance without raising a fuss.
- The Black Spider takes Dravik's weapons and tells him about the Old Owl Well, and how a red wizard of Thay is poking about down there. There are tunnels beneath, and the Black Spider has taken the Rockseeker brothers to keep them from prying as well. She plans to hold a meeting with the wizard. 
- Dravik tells her that he left the party on the outskirts of Conyberry. He is told he is meant to turn into a drider, a transformation that is implied to destroy him after a couple of days at most. The Black Spider tells him he was chosen as he was the most expendable, and no-one would miss him. Dravik takes umbrage to this and insists that his fate was not that, but the Black Spider derides him into submission.
--------
- Zinna and Corrin check out the Conyberry forge. Zinna finds a set of iron tongs that are incredibly well crafted. They belong to the master smith. As Corrin lifts a collapsed stone, he finds a glowing shard of some kind of white energy.  It causes Corrin's hand to grow frost, so Zinna grabs it with the tongs and puts it in her bag. 
	- Zinna is able to tell that it's part of a greater mechanism, likely crafted by ancient smiths with elven elements. She determines it will likely enhance whatever she uses it with.
- Sha wanders into another building. From observation, he finds himself in the Thornton family home. He finds a picture of young Hallia, as well as of her family. Behind the house there is a small graveyard with fresh flowers. He finds a letter from Hallia sending her love, then goes to examine the attic. After climbing on the table and fiddling with silverware, he breaks in and finds a small locket alongside a small journal.
	- Sha finds a drawing of a little boy, written beside it is "In loving memory of Adrian Thornton, two years old, taken from us too soon." It is Hallia's third sibling, alongside her older brother.
	- Sha skims the journal. He determines it is written in the voice of Hallia's mother and stows it away for later.
- Wendell gives the cigars to Sha. The group debates on what to do. The party discusses, then Wendell makes an offhand comment about Eldath being better, which sends the kobolds into a tizzy. A suspicious gust of wind passes them by. 
- The party ventures into the forest adjacent to the Neverwinter forest. It's around midday, but there is moonlight in the area. There is a towering ancient tree, known to locals as Agatha's tree. It once served as her home. The area was known as the Soothsayer's Hollow. Upon entering the magical zone around the hut, the group suddenly feels like there is something different. Something is different about the magic in here.
	- Zinna tries to cast magic stone. That spell in particular isn't affected by the magic zone there.
	- Sha casts Tempestuous Blade to coat his zone in lightning. The spell is unaffected by the area. 
	- The party feels like something should be different, but they can't figure it out.
	- Wendell casts Detect Magic. He determines that any spell cast will be upcasted to the next level. 
- Looking inside, they see some furniture and a crystal ball. It seems to be a place where people met Agatha for fortune-tellings. The party decides to go up together, so Soggi won't run in by himself. 
- As the party enters, the inside of the tree becomes vastly more foresty, different from the view they saw from the inside. The entrance outside seals shut. There are mirrors surrounding a pedestal with a book, which shimmer with different colors. 
-  Zinna tries to read the book through her familiar's eyes. The book shows nothing to the familiar, tries to charm Zinna into coming closer. Sha stops her. Soggi, sensing people are nervous, casts Bless as Corrin tries to approach the book. Corrin reads from the book as ancient text appears to him. His eyes are drawn to a mirror in front of him, where a vision of Agatha reveals itself to him.
- He sees a scene of Agatha's childhood, where her family talks about how Agatha's blessing will fill the world with the silvery blessing of their goddess. It shifts to wizards casting a spell over her crib. Corrin feels his eyes drawn to the mirror on the right. 
-  Corrin sees an older version of Agatha in her late teens as she embraces an older elven man, promising to stand at each others' side. There is a feeling of bittersweet longing. Corrin is pulled to look behind him. He gives the party a play by play of what is happening.
- The scene depicts Agatha confronting her husband, saying something like "Vinas". He accuses her of treachery, and her father comes up from behind, calling her Melaru(?). Her father tells her he fears that darkness has consumed her, and he must act in the best interest of the family. He sends her away, which elicits a feeling of heartbreak.
- He watches a scene of her turning into a banshee, filled with rage and grief. All of the mirrors turn back to normal. The book says some words about her being born of moonlight's grace, implying she is related to Selune in some way. 
- Will o wisps start falling from the roof and start dancing in a circle. The message on the book disappears and a new letter written in blood appears: Venas, my lover, you betrayed my trust and your name will be forever cursed. You may have bested me in this life, but may your name be forever cursed with strife., then something about him wandering on forever.
- A soft light envelops the room and Agatha begins to appear before Corrin. Corrin tries to give her the comb, and asks about asking her a question. Agatha, for free, tells Corrin that the friend they are searching for Dravik is unwell. She manifests in her hand a small crystal ball, which she gives to Corrin. She asks Corrin to take her remains so she may rest in the family crypt. She says she will encase her soul in the crystal and allow them access to her home. 
- She also asks for Corrin to look for a motif from her father; something to remind her that he once loved her. Then she asks Corrin for his question.
