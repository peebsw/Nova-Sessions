### Notes

- In the aftermath of the battle, [[Qelline Alderleaf]] thanks the party for their help. She tells them that dinner is on her, and offers them a place to rest. [[Wendell]] calls for the party to gather at the house. [[Esha]] wants to loot the body before they do anything else.
	- [[Esha]] finds: 1 embroidered silk handkerchief, 18 silver pieces.
- As the group approaches house, [[Thistle Alderleaf|Thistle]] (daughter) approaches [[Esha]] and asks about his injuries. She tells him her cat's name is named Felix and offers up her cat.
- The group brings the unconscious [[Redbrand]] into the house to interrogate them later. The cat runs off, and [[Corrin]] sees a full-grown woman in robes at the edge of the field. She disappears. 
- [[Zinna]], [[Thistle Alderleaf|Thistle]], and [[Corrin]] go off to find the "cat." [[Esha]] enters the house to get bandaged by [[Qelline Alderleaf]]. [[Dravik]] and [[Caiphene]] wait by the dining table. [[Zinna]] brings in the tied up bandit and loots him.
	- [[Zinna]] finds: shortsword, dagger. 
- [[Zinna]] fully heals up [[Esha]], who is still injured by the fight. 
- [[Qelline Alderleaf]] brings in a newspaper and tells the group that she is the editor. She tells the group that her late husband built a secret cellar in the basement of the house. Despite her warning the locals for weeks, no action has been taken against the [[Redbrand|Redbrands]].

- [[Zinna]] brings up that [[Wendell]] overheard the plot around her house. [[Qelline Alderleaf]] explains that the town master is the problem, as he has not lifted a finger to stop the [[Redbrand]]. [[Zinna]], [[Caiphene]], and [[Dravik]] hear the banging of a wheelbarrow just outside. It seems to be a grumpy old farmer from a neighboring locale. He looks through the window and mouths a couple of words, then holds up 3 fingers before moving away from the window.
- After a bit of talk, [[Qelline Alderleaf]] explains that the man likely dispatched 3 of the [[Redbrands]] in the woods, perhaps with a bit of help. The neighbor comes in. [[Wendell]] asks him if he's seen [[Gundren Rockseeker]], and the neighbor tells them he's situated at ==[[Daran Edermath]]'s== place.
- [[Zinna]] takes the opportunity to bring up the pouch she found on the [[Redbrands]] in the woods. She shows it to the neighbor, [[Leon]], who tells them that ==[[Sister Garael]]== might be able to give them some answers. 
- [[Qelline Alderleaf]] asks the group who they are as they eat. [[Dravik]] takes the opportunity to slip out and keep watch. He sees a couple of farm boys dragging the bodies out from the field. [[Qelline Alderleaf]] tells the group [[Sildar Hallwinter|Sildar]] used to be a local of Phandalin, then asks about the man left in the corner. [[Zinna]] tells her they plan to interrogate him. [[Esha]] says they should just kill him. [[Wendell]] suggests asking who sent him, and if they plan to send more.
- The [[Redbrand]] begins to wake up. [[Zinna]] goes to investigate. They interrogate him. He says he isn't sure who is the leader. The guy he reports to reports to ==[[Vraxen de Vrait|Vraxen]]==, but he doesn't know who is at the top. [[Dravik]] returns and tries to persuade [[Qelline Alderleaf]] and her kids to leave before the second group comes around to finish them off. She agrees, but asks the party to go and speak with the town master, as he does not listen to her anymore. She mentions the [[Halia Thornton]], and that the person who runs it, [[Halia Thornton]], would run the town better.
- The party decides to kill off the remaining bandit. [[Wendell]] steps in and suggests they turn him over to the garrisons. The party agrees, and [[Wendell]] steps out to turn over the [[Redbrand]] to the garrison, with [[Caiphene]] and [[Zinna]]. 
- As [[Wendell]], [[Caiphene]], and [[Zinna]] walk through the town at night, [[Caiphene]] sees, on the roof of the building, leaning against a chimney, a cloaked woman looking at the group. [[Caiphene]] calls [[Zinna]] over to look, but [[Zinna]] doesn't see anyone. [[Caiphene]] climbs on the roof to check, and finds that her feet perfectly fit within the space where the figure was.
- [[Wendell]] sees
	- Claw marks on the southern trail
	- Brigand activities
	- When guards were assigned to certain things
- However, nobody seems to be around. [[Wendell]] takes a ledger as evidence. They decide to leave the [[Redbrand]] in the cell and hand the keys over to the [[Halia Thornton]] over in the morning. In the meantime, the other half of the party delivers [[Qelline Alderleaf]] to safety.
- Upon reuniting, [[Dravik]] feels a presence in his mind. It tells him:
	- "Come and find me soon."
- The party arrives to [[Toblen Stonehill|Stonehill Inn]]. [[Zinna]] sets them up with food and bedding, then speaks to Toblin. They go up to get some sleep. [[Wendell]] and [[Zinna]] bunk together, [[Corrin]] and [[Dravik]] together, and [[Esha]] and [[Caiphene]] go together.
- At night, [[Dravik]] is called out by the mysterious voice. He meets up with the figure outside, successfully sneaking out, and reports back everything that he has observed -- both regarding the town and the party. He tells the figure all of the party's weaknesses and the woman praises him. She tells him to watch and wait, then produces a dagger which she hands over to [[Dravik]]. He tells her he is ready to serve and then she is gone.
- In the morning, [[Zinna]] and [[Corrin]] split off to go to the [[Halia Thornton]] while the rest of the party goes to check on the [[Redbrand]] and then to the [[Harbin Wester|Towmaster's Hall]].
- [[Zinna]] and [[Corrin]] arrive to the [[Halia Thornton]]. [[Zinna]] tells the woman running it, [[Halia Thornton]], about the [[Redbrand]] and hands her the keys. [[Halia Thornton]] tells her that the garrison was called back to Neverwinter, leaving the space woefully understaffed. Then, she lets [[Zinna]] use her workspace. [[Zinna]] explains she will be making an amulet and hands over 4 gp to make use of the workspace/materials.
- [[Corrin]] asks them about what metal they're mining in [[Phandalin]]. They explain that there have been various projects, one of them being mithral and glassteel. They offer to sell him some mithral, but [[Corrin]] tells them another time.
- [[Dravik]] and [[Esha]] are ambushed. [[Dravik]] beats them to the punch and kills one of the [[Redbrand]], then strips them of their gear. [[Wendell]] and [[Caiphene]] catch up to [[Esha]] and [[Dravik]] as they all enter the [[Harbin Wester|townmaster]]'s hall. There seems to be a long line of people waiting to be seen, but there is no [[Harbin Wester|townmaster]] in sight. 
- [[Dravik]] and [[Esha]] push themselves to the front after a fog cloud is cast to absorb the guards. [[Dravik]] busts down the door with a flail. [[Harbin Wester|Harbin]] is inside and introduces himself, claiming he is practicing for a performance. The party tries to threaten him for not investigating the matter of the farm, then pivots to ask what is keeping him so busy. [[Harbin Wester|Harbin]] claims there is a group of bandits in the southern hills led by [[Brughor Axe-Biter]]. He offers 600 gp to the entire party to dispose of him. [[Esha|Sha]] tries to negotiate 100 gp per person upfront, then 100 gp when they return.
- [[Glasstaff]] is using the [[Harbin Wester|old townmaster]]'s house on the hill. [[Harbin Wester]] instructs them to go to [[Grista Kettlecopp|Grista]], who was kidnapped by [[Brughor Axe-Biter|Brughor]]. She is also the one who has most direct communications to [[Glasstaff]].
