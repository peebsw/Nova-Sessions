### Notes

- Morning comes, no major events after [[Dravik]] is offered meat. Positioned about one and a half days away from [[Neverwinter]]. [[Corrin]] gets the fire going to make breakfast. He makes fried chicken for everyone.
- There are prints with blood on them in the trail ahead. [[Corrin]] winks and transmits the message, *"Bloody Footprints."* [[Dravik]] investigates and sees shoe prints and blood, he gets the feeling that one might have belonged to a sort of bird.
- The party travels about another hour and a half along the road. There's another one or two spots where there's a significant amount of blood. [[Zinna]] tries to investigate and deduces that someone is being dragged along, rather than walking.
- There is a griffin in the middle of the road, dead. [[Sildar Hallwinter|Sildar]] is next to the griffin, his armor is dented and there is a snapped off arrow in his shoulder blade. [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]] is next to him, frustrated.
- [[Caiphene]] heals [[Sildar Hallwinter|Sildar]]. [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]] says that the person tied up is a [[Redbrand|Redbrand]].
- [[Sildar Hallwinter|Sildar]] mourns his griffin, mentions [Lathander]((https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Lathander)). [[Wendell|Wendell]] offers some words of condolences. The party gets a move on. [[Dravik]] picks up some griffin feathers from the ground. [[Wendell|Wendell]] puts it back, [[Sha]] puts it in their pocket.
- [[Corrin]] asks the [[Redbrand|Redbrand]] if they understand what they did was wrong, trying to play nice cop. [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]] is trying to keep the situation under wraps, choosing his words carefully.
- [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]] tells [[Corrin]] that the mines he is trying to uncover have historical value for anyone who finds them. The Lost Mine is home to one of the old ancient dwarven forges, said to be the home of the great weapons of legends. 
- [[Zinna]] makes a contraption for [[Sha]] to threaten the [[Redbrand]] with. They try to bribe him for information. They let the [[Redbrand|Redbrand]] go, [[Corrin]] and [[Wendell|Wendell]] go to bury the griffin.
- We continue on and find some red cloaks and fallen items. There is a damaged note. [[Zinna]] finds:
	- A pouch with an unfamiliar sigil (I'll bring that up next session to see if anyone recognizes it)
	- A half burnt letter that was illegible
- We continue on and come upon a stone marker that states "[[Phandalin]], 18 miles." There is an odor of filth, a rancid smell. [[Corrin]] comes to the conclusion that we've come to some sort of ambush. We fight multiple goblins and a troll.
- [[Sha]] pushes multiple goblins out of tree. We play grenade hot potato with troll. Ultimately, everyone is defeated and we come out relatively unscathed.
