We blasted Glass-staff's glass ass and he got us good but we did him one better.

#### Notes

- Outstanding plot threads:
	- [[Gundren Rockseeker]] seeking [[Forge of Spells]] in [[Wave Echo Cave]]
	- [[Redbrand]] keeping their foothold in Phandalin -- we only killed a shapeshifter.
	- Orc raider to the South, tasked by [[Harbin Wester]]

- Boss Loot
	- 180gp
	- 5 carnelians, 2 peridots, 1 pearl
	- Scroll of Charm Person (unidentified)
	- Scroll of Burning Hands (unidentified)
	- A body
- [[Zinna]] plans to cast Identify on the staff. She takes the staff, the scrolls, and [[Esha]] takes the gems. [[Zinna]] puts the items in her bag of holding. The party deduces that the corpse we found in the same room is, indeed [[Glassstaff]]. [[Zinna]] takes the staff and scrolls. She asks for a gem to power a construct she is working on.
- As the party heads back, [[Esha]] notices there was a secret escape door that Glass-staff had intended to use in the room. It was a secret staircase down to the room the party entered just before entering [[Ixal]]'s cave. 
- [[Wendell]] and [[Caiphene]] go to look for the fox on the way out, but see no signs of fox dens or the fox from before. They know the fox is peculiar and distinct from the other foxes.
- The party heads back to town. It seems the town is a bit more peaceful. The Sleeping Giant is notably quiet; there appears to be a few folks in there, but [[Zinna]] and [[Dravik]] notice that it has significantly cleared out. The party runs into [[Toblen Stonehill|Toblen]], and [[Wendell]] almost tells him about the manor, but [[Dravik]] stops him short and tells them they explored the woods.
- [[Toblen Stonehill|Toblen]] explains he caught up with Halia and that there has been some developments. She wants to speak to the party. The party goes to the [[Halia Thornton]] to speak with her, and so [[Zinna]] can work on her contraption, and so [[Corrin]] can work on studded leather armor. The receptionist offers him an iron ingot for 10 gp. The receptionist recommends the shop The Lion's Shield Cloister(?) run by [[Lanine Greywind]].
- The receptionist tells them they're full up, and to come back later. She guides them to [[Halia]], but the rest of the party is reticent. [[Zinna]] offers to go up with [[Wendell]], but asks [[Esha]] for a peridot for her owl contraption.
- The party (sans [[Dravik]], who is keeping watch), goes up to see [[Halia]]. [[Zinna]] shows [[Halia]] her owl contraption, but [[Corrin]] redirects her to the [[Redbrand]] situation. He tells [[Halia Thornton]] they have taken care of Glass-staff, which seems to delight [[Halia Thornton]]. They tell her that [[Glassstaff]] seemed to have been dead for a while, and a shapeshifter took his place. 
- She gives the party 350 gp.
- [[Halia Thornton]] asks the party about the Nothic, [[Ixal]]. She mentions having had visions of the depths, to which [[Wendell]] assures her that he has visions of the depths too, and it's entirely normal. [[Esha]] asks for the reward to be rounded up to 360 gp, to split it evenly. [[Halia Thornton]] agrees. 
- [[Halia Thornton]] tells them she has a ring that will limit the ability for the creature to read minds. She tells the party it would be best to not let the residents of [[Phandalin]] know about [[Ixal]]. She gives the ring to [[Corrin]], who hands it to [[Esha]]. She says she has two letters, one addressed to [[Corrin]] from [[Rye]], and the other from the woman we freed. She tells us the house behind the [[Halia Thornton]], 3 bedrooms and a workshop. 
- [[Wendell]] suggests giving it away to someone in need; the party reminds him that THEY are in need. [[Halia Thornton]] signs over the homestead to them. After the meeting, [[Zinna]] and [[Corrin]] are taken to their workstations, where [[Zinna]] does manage to infuse her homonculus with a bit of power from her gem.
- At the house, [[Zinna]] brings out the items she found in the cave:
	- Gold & Silver 65 silver pieces (tarnished with old minting) 
	- 35 gold pieces (some stamped with [[Lord Talemar Tresendar]] heraldry, a fox symbol) 
	- A small velvet pouch containing 5 carnelian gemstones 
	- Weapon Talon (Magic Longsword, +1) A longsword of fine Neverwinter make, engraved with the symbol of flying hawk. Effect: Grants +1 to attack and damage rolls. Lore bite: Once wielded by Aldith [[Lord Talemar Tresendar]], the Blackhawk, the chief guard of the [[Lord Talemar Tresendar]] family, who fought orcs in these very tunnels centuries ago.
	- An elven silk wrapped rusted dagger—a curiosity, though no residual magic. 
	- A bronze signet ring with the same faded engraving of the fox [[Lord Talemar Tresendar]] family crest, worth 10gp. 
	- A sealed scroll case, its wax sigil long broken—empty, but ancient.
- [[Zinna]] asks for the other peridot from [[Esha]]. She brings out her homonculus owl, and now has two: an owl familiar and a homonculus owl. 
- The party decides to keep some money at the house:
	- 65 silver pieces 
	- 35 gold pieces
- [[Caiphene]] shows the party the puzzle box as [[Corrin]] cooks, and uses the comprehend languages scroll. 
	- She reads: 
	-  "T’yin vel’klar zhaun olplyn, lueth ukta ssinssrin dal zhennu." (The first shapes truth from darkness and remembers what is unseen.) 
	- "T'yin olplyn ph’ vel’klar, lueth udosst ssinssrigg Lenna’khel." (The second sees where it stands, though can be tricked.) 
	- "T'yin kyorl phorzhul zhaun kyorl d'zahra, vur zhennar velkyn." (The third gazes upon the hollow, where even shadows do not dare tread.)
- [[Dravik]] understands "the hollow where even shadows do not dare tread" to be a drow saying about when a soul departs a body. The saying follows a line of thought that represents the most terrible existence for a Drow -- an existence so terrible that even shadows would avoid it. The loss of their soul. The ultimate degradation.
- All the party tries to solve the box. They decide on "mind eye soul", which seems to lock into place. However, it seems there is one extra step. It occurs to [[Caiphene]] to pull the two sides of the box apart. It opens. There is a a silver comb.
- [[Sildar Hallwinter]] arrives at the front door with a housewarming gift: brandy and a small leather journal with blank pages. [[Zinna]] shows him her owl and how she can cast spells through it. [[Sildar Hallwinter|Sildar]] throws a stone, experimentally at her, and she takes damage. [[Corrin]] heals her up and [[Sildar Hallwinter]] apologizes. [[Zinna]] names her other owl, "Dinna."
- [[Wendell]] suggests talking, and [[Sildar Hallwinter|Sildar]] gives [[Dravik]] some more liquor. [[Wendell]] asks [[Corrin]], [[Caiphene]], and [[Esha]] where they're from.
	- [[Corrin]] says he's from [[Redlarge]], [[Julkoun]], a bit southeast, over the Sword Coast mountains. An incredible amount of goats and sheep were raised there.
	- [[Caiphene]] says she's from [[Illusk]], which [[Sildar Hallwinter|Sildar]] tries to correct to [[Luskan]], as he says it's what it used to be called many years ago. She says she doesn't consider what that place is to be her home. She says she's coming up on being 230 now. [[Sildar Hallwinter|Sildar]] says in human years, he's 68. 
	-  [[Esha]] tells them he was from a ship, and that was his home, as well as the crew he was a part of. He tries to explain it as a group that has members who come and go as they work. 
- [[Sildar Hallwinter]] asks [[Dravik]] if he's from [[Menzoberranzan]], as that's where most of the drow he's met are from. He's heard that despite its hostility towards outsiders, it's quite a beautiful place. 
	- He points over at [[Zinna]], who explains that she's from Waterdeep, and that she met [[Corrin]] through his kid. 
	- [[Sildar Hallwinter|Sildar]] talks a little bit about how him and [[Wendell]] met, at [[Dellwyn Lake]].
	- [[Sildar Hallwinter|Sildar]] explains that he is from [[Phandalin]], he decided to join the Lord's Alliance to deal with the rising bandit problem.
- [[Sildar Hallwinter]] explains that him and [[Glasstaff]] used to be friends, and [[Wendell]] tells him they found his corpse, and that he was doing necromancy. It saddens him, but he tells them they did a great justice. 
- [[Sildar Hallwinter]] asks them what's next, and the party tells him they still have the other general. [[Corrin]] asks him about the dwarven city [[Gauntlgrym]]. [[Sildar Hallwinter|Sildar]] asks him if he remembers about the volcano he mentioned.  There is a passage through the mountains, it used to be an old trade route but it got sealed off. [[Corrin]] tells him that his kid is going on a trip there, to look for something.
- [[Sildar Hallwinter|Sildar]] says if he was looking for a forge, he would check that place out, or the city of [[Mithral Hall]], further to the north. He leaves, and [[Wendell]] sees him off.
- [[Zinna]] goes out and does some target practice. [[Wendell]] goes out to pray. [[Corrin]] writes a response letter to [[Rye]]. 
- After some rest, the party decides to see [[Sister Garael]]. [[Corrin]] works on his studded leather. [[Wendell]] takes the Glass Staff . It has the following properties:
	- It has 6 charges. 
	- You can cast Mage Armor (1 charge) without using spell slots.
- The party sees a procession of people, with [[Toblen Stonehill]] bound. He is bloodied. Ahead of him is [[Vraxen de Vrait]], who yanks him forward and into the center of the shrine. A couple of bugbears and [[Redbrand|Redbrands]] assemble rough gallows. The party heads in to fight.
