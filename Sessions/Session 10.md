title: Last Session Recap
collapse: open

After uncovering the real Glassstaff's corpse and dispatching his shapeshifting impersonator, the party returned to Phandalin with loot. While Zinna began work on a magical construct using the staff and scrolls, Halia Thornton rewarded the group handsomely and offered them a homestead, which they accepted (despite Wendellâ€™s brief urge to donate it). The group enjoyed a brief respite, only to witness Toblen Stonehill dragged to a public execution by Vraxen de Vrait and his forces, prompting the party take action.

#### Notes

- Vraxen nearly kills Toblen, but narrowly misses.
- Wendell is starstruck by the cool druid Raidof(?) and wildshapes into a wolf. He also summons a little owl and names it Rowan.
- Dravik sees the Lady of the Night in the crowd, and the two silently agree that the fight is the perfect distraction/time to take care of Gundren.
- Halia delivers the finishing blow to Vraxen and numerous other NPCs. 
- The party cleans up the rest.
- Lt. Garren and his men finally arrive -- they represent the Lord's Alliance. Around 18 people were lost in the battle.
- Sildar wonders where the Rockseeker brothers are, Dravik pretends to wonder too.
