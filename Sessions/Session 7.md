title: Last Session Recap
collapse: closed

The party infiltrates the ruins of Tresendar Manor through an old service entrance, discovering traces of the Redbrands. A mysterious magical fox watches them before vanishing. Inside, they encounter eerie inscriptions and artifacts linked to the Tresendar family, including a silver ladle and a nobleâ€™s locket. Fighting off bandits, they hide the bodies and navigate a deadly trap before reaching the family crypt, where they uncover the legacy of Lord Talemar Tresendar. After disturbing the tombs, skeletal guardians attack. The party also rescues prisoners from Redbrand jailers and finds evidence of a human trafficking operation.

#### Notes

- [[Zinna]] feeds the woman, [[Yvette]], and her children some of her rations. [[Zinna]] guides the family out as [[Wendell]] speaks to [[Session Notes/Wendell's Notes/NPCS/Phandalin/Jonah]]. [[Session Notes/Wendell's Notes/NPCS/Phandalin/Jonah]] tells us that the man who died used to be a woodcutter in town.
- [[Session Notes/Wendell's Notes/NPCS/Phandalin/Jonah]] tells the group that [[Glasstaff]] used to be named [[Glasstaff|Iarno]], a wizard for the Lord's Alliance. He tells the group that an element of surprise would serve them well, as [[Glasstaff]] is crafty.
- [[Dravik]] casts *Divine Sense* and feels, at the edge of his awareness, something wrong. He feels the presence of an aberration. 
- [[Zinna]], [[Corrin]], and [[Wendell]] guide out [[Yvette]], her kids, and [[Session Notes/Wendell's Notes/NPCS/Phandalin/Tresendar Manor/Jonah|Jonah]]. [[Zinna]] gives over some gold. [[Yvette]] tells us that her cousin lives on Umbridge Hill and the group leaves to go there, as Phandalin is too unsafe for her family.
- The group heals up [[Sha]] and [[Wendell]] before taking the door through the crypt. There is a long hallway with two doors, one hidden. The group takes the hidden passage and finds a room with crates that looks like a base for mining operations and a dark cave entrance. There are a dozen red cloaks on the wall. [[Zinna]] sends her owl through the cave entrance.
- There are sickly green lights from fungi and ancient scaffolding, along with long bridges that bridge gaps over a chasm that's so deep it leads to the Underdark. There is a platform and a rope hanging from one of the bridges. Tied to the rope is a moving skeleton. 
- The party goes back to check the other room and finds an armory. Inside:
			- Eleven **spears**
			- Six **shortswords**
			- Two **longswords**
			- Two **light crossbows**
			- Two quivers, each with **twenty crossbow bolts**
			- Unshipped pack of beaver pelts, fine cloth, tobacco leaves. Barrel containing lesser quality iron ingots, bundle of glassware that looks nice but is knockoff glassware. Within sealed crate, small black lockbox.
- The group takes some weapons, the lockbox, the fine cloth.
- [[Esha|Sha]] investigates some of the financial ledgers, prompted by a note [[Dravik]] slipped them prior to entering the manor depths. [[Esha|Sha]] reads the [[Letter to Glass-Staff.pdf.pdf|Letter to Glass-Staff]] and pockets it, along with other notes he has found. [[Zinna]] finds 35 gp and a set of dice that look like they belong to a gambler.
- [[Zinna]] also finds that the box has a false bottom. She finds a little book of notes hidden within. She reads what seems to be written from the perspective of a [[Redbrand]]. They took notes on the place and what they write about is:
	- The Tresendars knew of the mine. Their wealth was built on the backs of the enslaved.
	- The [[Redbrand|Redbrands]] were no better; they are using their old holding cells for their workforce.
	- There is an ancient magic in the crypt compelling the skeletons to come out and attack if anyone disturbs the area.
- As [[Zinna]] reads, [[Zinna]] and [[Dravik]] feel a presence in their minds telling them that they should not be there. Then: *Red cloaks scurrying around like rats.*
- [[Zinna]] asks about [[Glasstaff]]; the voice seems to hate him. It tells her to come closer. Then, the group all hears the voice. As the group debates, they see a greenish apparition form in the cave entrance. It's almost like an arm, pitching a still-alive [[Redbrand]] towards the group. He looks pale with terror, his limbs trembling.
- The voice returns: *"Treacherous, he is. He awoke the old masters of this manor. Do you not think he should be punished?"* [[Corrin]] asks if they mean the skeletons; the voice tells them that he is the reason they were attacked. [[Wendell]] asks the [[Redbrand]] if they saw the thing. He tells them it had spikes everywhere and a large eye.
- [[Sha]] tries to recall what it was. He knows that there was a cabal of mages tampering with magic far more than they should have. He remembers hearing about a creature who was formed by the mages being pulled into the pocket dimensions to the Far Plane. It changed them into monstrosities and drove them to insanity. He knows it is a *Nothic*. 
- The Nothic combs through the parties' feelings on the [[Redbrand]], and whether it should live or die. Most seem to not care/want it to die. Some are curious/fearful of it. Some pity the [[Redbrand]].
	- The Nothic tells the group its name is *[[Ixal]]* and it welcomes the group in. [[Wendell]] and [[Zinna]] lead the way in. [[Wendell]] tries to get the Nothic to vow it won't hurt them, and it seems to agree. [[Zinna]] talks about the [[Redbrand]] and how they are a nuisance with [[Ixal]]. [[Zinna]] tells it that it looks like a sculpture made of rocks with a big eye on it, which seems to upset it deeply. It disappears. [[Dravik]] gets rid of a skeleton hanging off the bridge. The group uses *feather fall* to jump down, then [[Zinna]] crosses the bridge. She sees a tunnel below when she reaches the midpoint.
- [[Zinna]] sends her owl to check out the cave entrance, and as Tina the owl examines it, she sees silver engravings on a wooden chest. She makes out the words: *Property of [[Lord Talemar Tresendar|Talemar]] [[Lord Talemar Tresendar|Tresendar]].* 
- [[Dravik]] and [[Esha|Sha]] hang back, wary of the bridge. They are nearly frightened, while [[Zinna]] persuades [[Ixal]] to carry her to the chest. He offers her his hand and she climbs on. She takes everything from the chest and returns, as [[Esha|Sha]] hurries across the second bridge to join the group. [[Ixal]] invites them to rest. The party asks if they can trust him to keep an eye for any [[Redbrand|Redbrands]]; in response, [[Ixal]] brings out the [[Redbrand]] that they left behind, draining him of his life force. Horrified, the party takes a long rest.
