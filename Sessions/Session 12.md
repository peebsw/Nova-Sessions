title: Last Session Recap
collapse: open

After the skirmish, Sha claims a Loxodon tusk while Dravik respectfully handles the dead. The party recovers various intriguing items, including silver swords, a mysterious powder made from a wraith, and a scroll of invisibility. Caiphene has a quiet moment with Sister Garael, who urges her to seek out Agatha the banshee with a personal question and a gift that may stir her memory. Meanwhile, Wendell is welcomed into a druidic circle and earns the title of Spring Warden, gaining new magic and knowledge. Raidoth warns of growing goblin aggression under a figure called the Black Spider, who seeks something ancient near the Old Owl Well. Suspicion grows around Dravikâ€™s loyalties after a tense conversation with Corrin. The group makes preparations and travels toward Conyberry, encountering owlbears, ruined trade routes, and signs of gnoll activity. They arrive at the eerie, crumbling ruins of Conyberry, with the sense that something - or someone - is watching.

```

#### Notes

-  The center of Conyberry still seems to be intact. There is a watchtower, as well as a lake. Zinna sends her owls to scout the area.
- The owls notice that there are ten key locations of interest out of the ten houses:
	- 1) A chapel
	- 2) Well 
	- 3) Conyberry Forge
	- 4) Barracks
	- 5) An inn
	- 6) Dance hall
	- 7) ???
	- 8) ???
	- 9) ???
	- 10) ???
- The owls also notice small tracks in between the buildings, though they are not human. Zinna also notices that there are three orcs approaching. One is a leader, another a shaman, and the third is accompanied by a worg. Zinna sends over her two owls to feel out the orcs, who appear to be raiders. 
- One of them is dressed in more tattered robes - a shaman. He holds up a small totem. He is covered in tattoos, which seem to light up. He tells the rest of the raiders to be quiet, "The wizard pet is watching us. If we follow the wizard pet, we can find the wizard." 
- As Zinna casts *Tasha's Caustic Brew*, one of the orcs tries to raise his war horn to blow it. Dinna the owl tries to swipe it, but the orc manages to blow it.
- The party enters into combat against a large group of orcs. Some are on worgs, and they are headed by the orc leader and his shaman in the rear.
	- The owls deliver a series of drone strikes against the orcs.
	- An entangle spell catches most of them. Caiphene sets it on fire, burning them alive.
	- An orc and his worg charge at Wendell. Wendell manages to redirect the worg with an animal handling check, telling it to flee the battle to spare it, which it does. The orc cleaves him, and he's downed.
	- Corrin stabilizes Wendell as Caiphene is downed and is narrowly missed by a fireball. The two are unconscious by the well. 
	- Zinna revives Caiphene, who tosses a fog cloud and uses it to hide in the foliage. She dispels it as Sha comes in to attack. The orc tries to disarm him, but Sha summons another weapon.
	- Corrin feeds Wendell some goodberries, which revives him. The fire on one of the orcs spreads, catching a nearby house on fire. The orc that is on fire lobs a spear at Sha, which hits. 
	- Caiphene brings Sha back up, as another orc fells Wendell again by using a wolf as a club. Corrin scrambles to gather his goodberries as Sha attacks. Then Corrin smashes the orc with his maul. In the back, the orc that is on fire is burned and the fire spreads further.
	- One orc tries to run away, and Zinna sends her owls after him. The owl summoned by *Find Familiar,* Tinna, is destroyed. Zinna pounces on another orc and brings him down. 
	- The party teams up to put out the fire before it completely destroys the barracks. Corrin finds a body in the well as he looks for a bucket.
- The orcs have the following:
	- A totem
	- A map of the orc's main camp
	- Fire opal
- At the well, there is an inscription: Coward's Well. Sha and Wendell help lower Zinna inside to get the corpse. Zinna finds the town's former townmaster. She also finds the leather cover of a journal, pulpy and unreadable. On one of the fingers there is a gold ring, relatively untarnished. Wendell tells her to not leave the skeleton down there, so Zinna puts the skeleton in the bag of holding, along with the journal.
- Wendell takes the skeleton with the intent to bury it. On his way to the graveyard, he hears someone near the wharf. The party heads down after healing up. 
- Caiphene sees, under the wharf, where people would do their fishing, two small kobolds, Screet and Soggy,. talking to each other. 
	- Soggy is light blueish grey with perpetually damp scales and one eye that is larger than the other. His left horn is broken halfway, and he wears a crudely made holy symbol of Tymora + little trinkets like feathers and metal.
	- Screet is taller, with a long tail with a kink in it. She has a tattered red ribbon around her right horn, and has battle scars from their time with the dragon.
- One holds up his holy symbol, claiming to serve Tymora. Wendell asks Caiphene about Sister Garael, who also serves her. The kobolds seem to lighten up a bit at the mention of another person serving Tymora. Sha goes into the shack, and Wendell suggests Caiphene go in, as she is more familiar with Tymora. 
- Inside there is a table with offerings on it, including a tackle box that reads: River's Bounty Festival. As they get closer, they see parts of the lake that seem to unnaturally shimmer with a blue-green light, occasionally rippling under the surface. 
- The shrine itself is under a table, a crude little altar made of broken furniture. Atop it is a silver coin on a string, hung up so it can spin. There are several "treasures": some colorful glass, unusual stones, charred toys, and various items. They say that every day they spin the sacred coin and say their prayers; they believe that one day it will land on its edge, and their luck will change forever. 
- They ask Sha and Caiphene if they'd like to make an offering. Sha puts down the little clapping monkey toy that Zinna gave him earlier. The kobolds don't like it, so Sha switches it for a gold coin. Sha doesn't believe in the gods, so he's doing it to be nice. 
- The kobolds ask if they'd like to know why they became followers of Tymora. They say they serve the mighty Pyrotentrix, a red dragon who had a bad temper. Then some adventurers came, who killed her. They escaped, but then were captured by drow, who made them mine mushrooms. They were terribly allergic and sneezed, which somehow helped them escape. They found their way out, emerging right into a battle between orcs in the village. They escaped, then a building collapsed on them. They survived, but then got fooded out of their shelter, and pushed through a crack in the wall. 
- They say there is another one of them there, Vrizrak, who lives in the watchtower. He's very smart, but very grumpy. They say he is obsessed with those floating earth chunks up in the sky -- pieces of the Netherese empire where powerful wizards created floating islands. They are earth motes, remnants of floating cities.
- The kobolds explain that Vrizrak is trying to figure out how to get them up there. They tell them that to find him, he's up in the watchtower past the old tree with the lightning scar. But if they go near, to be careful, as he set up lots of traps. To get past, they should go on the safe path marked with red stones. He might also like an offering, something shiny, like metal.
- Corrin grabs a fishing rod to fish for their dinner. The kobolds tell them to be careful about the "ghost fish." The kobolds are initially hesitant to talk about it, but then explain that when they ate the ghost fish, they started to see the ghosts of the people who lived there. 
- Corrin fishes and catches several things. 
	- River Trout: Provides one meal
	- Silverscale: Meat stays fresh for 1 week without preservation
	- Luminous Eel: Glows for 24 hours after death (provides light as a candle)
	- Dreaming Koi: ????
	- Conya's Blessing: Healing properties (When cooked, gives 1d4+2 temp HP to the first three to eat it.)
	- Timeswimmer: Consuming provides a one-time reroll of any check or save within 24 hours
	- The Thing Below: Not a fish at all, but a tiny water elemental that's been trapped in the lake.
- The tiny water elemental, disturbed, immediately lashes out. Corrin tries to strike it with his hammer, but the hammer does nothing. Wendell uses shape water on it, which scares it back into the water. 
- The party distributes the fish among themselves. 
	- river trout - corrin 
	- silverscale -- zinna 
	- eel - kobolds 
	- koi - wendell 
	- conyas blessing - caiphene 
	- timeswimmer - sha 
	- the thing below - went back below
- As Wendell eats his fish, he feels himself say: "I can see." Corrin asks what he can see, not realizing Wendell has entered a trance state. His consciousness is lifted above the city, viewing the time before Conyberry was destroyed. There is life in the city, villagers milling through. He is placed in the center, like he is a ghost, as he can feel people walking through him. 
- Time passes by within the vision. He sees the eras of Conyberry passing, marked by the arrival of a tribe. A warhorn sounds, and the atmosphere changes to immediate fear. An elven woman, along with other guards from the town, are pointing bows and arrows towards the incoming raiders. The market square erupts into chaos, citizens running for cover as the raiders encroach upon the town. The chieftain, wielding a greataxe, leads them all towards the chapel, where women, children, are barricaded in the building. The raiders set the building alight. People are dragged out into the center and beheaded mercilessly. They are ruthless, slaughtering countless innocents. Then, they point to the north, saying "The witch is in there. Let's get her."
- Time passes further, the town decays. Wendell comes to, sobbing. He tells the party about the horrible sights, which distress him greatly. Corrin and Sha comfort him, and finally get him to his senses when they ask him how the fish was. He tells them that the orcs in the vision mentioned the witch in the north; the party deduces that this was Agatha, before she became a banshee. They realize that bringing the comb to her might make her remember her former self, before the raiders came and drove her to despair, turning her into a banshee.
