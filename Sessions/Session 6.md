### Notes

- The old service entrance of the manor becomes apparent. It is a small crack in the entrance in the ruins of [[Lord Talemar Tresendar|Tresendar Manor]]. There are traces of the [[Redbrand|Redbrands]] having used the entrance over the past few days. The sun has begun to set, it is nearly evening. As the group enters, [[Caiphene]] spots a fox behind them, watching them as they enter the manor. [[Wendell]] and [[Caiphene]] deduce that the fox is magical in some way, as it vanishes into thin air. [[Wendell]] promises to try to speak to it when if they make it out of the manor in one piece.
- [[Wendell]] sees, on the side of the basin: *"For the fox. May his walk among the living cease.* -[[Lenna|L]]". As [[Zinna]] gets close to the edge of the fountain, she sees a little alcove carved into the stone in the water. There is a glint of silver on the box, which attracts [[Zinna]]'s attention. A creature, oily and scaled, snake-like, snaps out, trying to get at [[Wendell]]'s arm. [[Zinna]] pulls him away, and the box is thrown at [[Zinna]]'s feet. They both agree to not get anywhere near the water again.
- [[Esha|Sha]] notices sounds of a couple of snores on the other side of the door. [[Esha|Sha]] opens the door, creaking it open. The group fights four bandits inside the room. They decide to take a short rest, and [[Zinna]] opens the box to check what's inside.
	- [[Zinna]] finds: a silver-tipped ladle with markings on it: [[Lenna]]. The handle bears the insignia of a faded fox. She also finds a little locket made of gold, faded (maybe fake gold?) There is a drawn portrait of a man in noble regalia, with the initials "[[Lord Talemar Tresendar|T.T.]]" inside the frame.
- [[Zinna]] assumes [[Lord Talemar Tresendar|Tresendar]] might be one of those initials. She recognizes that the nobleman might have had something to do with this manor. [[Zinna]] gets some water with the ladle for the fox from the fountain. [[Zinna]], [[Wendell]], and [[Caiphene]] plan to feed some to the fox when they exit.
- [[Corrin]] finds:
	- a club, a dagger, and a crossbow with 6 bolts and 3 gp, a small pouch of cooking herbs, a lucky charm (a poorly carved wooden bead strung with a piece of twine), a flask of cheap liquor, a small sketchbook (with VERY nice drawings), and a love letter. 
- [[Corrin]] makes a note to publish them later. [[Wendell]] takes the wooden bead/lucky charm. The party chucks the bodies in the water to hide them.
- [[Esha|Sha]] finds a fake stone wall between the staircases and an alternate door. We take the door between the staircase and accidentally trigger a wire that makes the floor fall out from under the party. [[Corrin]] and [[Zinna]] make a bridge from the wooden barrels and the party crosses. The party enters the [[Lord Talemar Tresendar|Tresendar]] family crypt.
	- Writing etched in small telling the stories about the people who lived there. On the sarcophagi are bodies etched in the shape of the people within. The bodies are: [[Lady Ilith Tresendar]], [[Lady Ilith Tresendar|Keeper of the Light]], and [[Sir Aldith Tresendar]], [[Sir Aldith Tresendar|the Black Hawk]], and [[Lord Talemar Tresendar]], [[Lord Talemar Tresendar|the Last of his Line]].
		- [[Sir Aldith Tresendar]] seems to be a knight in silver armor, foot planted over the body of an orc chieftan.
		- [[Lord Talemar Tresendar|Lord Talemar]]'s portrait has been scuffed, almost scratched out. There is a lone man kneeling at the end of his chair. It's a depiction of someone paying their respects to their lord.
	- On [[Lord Talemar Tresendar|Telemar]]'s coffin is the carving: "[[Lord Talemar Tresendar|Last of his Line]]." [[Zinna]] leaves the locket on the hands there.
	- The woman's hands are raised, holding a lantern. She's cloaked and at her feet are figures huddled beside her: women, wounded, children. Her carving says "[[Lady Ilith Tresendar]], [[Lady Ilith Tresendar|Keeper of the Light]]."
	- Beneath all of them is a family motto: *"Let them never wake."*
- [[Wendell]] hears something that sounds like *"Let us rest."* So, he urges the party to get a move on. [[Esha|Sha]] tries to listen behind one of the doorways at the end of the crypt, but only sees that there seems to be a warmer light behind the door. [[Wendell]] goes and opens it the moment [[Esha|Sha]] tells them that there is someone crying on the other side. They find people beaten, ragged on the floor, kept behind cells by two [[Redbrand|Redbrand]] jailers.
- The party fights the jailers, tries to find the keys. [[Esha|Sha]] finds 35 silver pieces and a letter from a contact in Neverwinter: *"We have buyers. Get them to the coast soon."* The signature says, "[[Everard Vandemere|V]]."
- 3 skeletons attack; we find out they are the ones inside the tombs. [[Lord Talemar Tresendar|Lord Telamar]] was carrying a small key, [[Sir Aldith Tresendar|Sir Aldith]] was carrying a chainless amulet and a ring he is holding: *"My life for the fox."* [[Lady Ilith Tresendar|Lady Ilith]] has a silver signet ring: it has an aura of protection; it used to be a *ring of detect magic*.
