Note: Day 3 of being in Phandalin
### Notes

-  Harbin confirms that the party is going to take care of the issue in the hills with Wendell. He tells them that the bandits that have been hiding out in the south have been attacking from their new base of operations, Wyvern Tor. He tells us to bring the head of Brughor to the receptionist. Dravik tells him they plan to bring the head to him directly, which makes Harbin recoil.
- Wendell gives out 150 gp to every member of the party, then the group heads to the south. They stop by the Miner's Exchange, where ZInna goes off to one of the side forges to work on a magical item of her own. She positions herself at a workbench and, with a griffin feather and a metal item, creates a magical item with 2 charges.
- Corrin is at the reception area. Above, he hears some footsteps descending from upstairs. A woman (Thornton) approaches with a dwarf at her side. They are negotiating in hushed tones. It is not Gundren, but rather an unknown dwarf named Nundro.  They make an agreement in negotiations and part way. Thornton approaches Corrin and greets him. She asks how long he's been in town and asks him about his purpose in town. Corrin informs them he is a blacksmith, and Thornton introduces him to ==Nundro Rockseeker==. 
- Corrin tells Nundro that they came on a job from Gundren, and that they delivered the supplies to the warehouse owned by Barthen. Corrin mentions their travel and the Redbrands, which piques Thornton's interest. Corrin gets the sense that she's well connected. Nundro asks whether they fought off the Redbrands, and whether Sildar and Gundren were safe. Corrin confirms they disposed of the Redbrands save for one. Nundro mentions that the town is going downhill; Halia invites Corrin for a drink upstairs and asks about the party.
- The party arrives then, as Halia leads Corrin upstairs. The receptionist asks the party to state their business. Dravik asks for Corrin and Zinna, and the receptionist calls Halia, who invites them upstairs. Halia gives them all a drink and expresses gratitude for the party saving Qelline. She explains that her and Qelline are very close, she is the children's godmother. She has always worked at the Miner's Exchange and it is a family business. She wasn't born in Phandalin, but she's developed a soft spot for everyone. 
- She asks the party to take care of the Redbrands. Caiphene, Corrin and Wendell are for it, Dravik has more questions, Sha is questioning her authority. Corrin agrees that the Redbrands need to be taken care of and wants to think it over, but Halia expresses that the matter is too urgent to wait. She explains that Sildar is already part of the resistance. She also explains that the Redbrands have two leaders (Braxen and Glasstaff) with two key bases in town:
	- The Sleeping Giant Inn
		- Braxen and the Redbrands sleep there and take out their pent up aggressions on the people.
	- The Manor up on the hill
		- The other leader, Glasstaff, resides there with the Redbrands.
- She suggests kidnapping Glasstaff or taking him out. Sha asks about the bandits in the south. Halia corrects Sha that they are less bandits and more raiders -- orcs. She explains that while they are still relevant to the safety of the people, they are less pressing than the Redbrand threat. She muses that Harbin probably sent them that way to get the party out of his hair.
- She gives the party a sending stone so they can keep in communication. The party discusses whether or not they can trust Halia. Wendell vouches for her, but the party remains a bit wary. At the very least, they plan on getting the Redbrands taken care of. The party plans to go to Edermath's orchard to find Gundren before they make any moves.
- It is known that Edermath is a supplier of alcohol for the town. The party sees Tharden (a third brother) and Gundren on the hill of Edermath orchard, having a dispute of some kind. A few of the party members hear the brothers arguing, Tharden talks about claiming the Forge before it gets blocked by bureaucracy. Gundren tells Tharden that Halia will want in on the forge, and that she has ears in every corner. 
- Corrin talks to the two, looking for advice on how to deal with the Redbrands. He sides with Gundren, but tells Tharden that they don't trust Halia's political way of speaking. Tharden and Gundren tell him that the inn, The Sleeping Giant, is going to attack Stonehill as it's competition. He doesn't know when, but he recommends that they go see Sildar, who is talking to Darren.
- Darren and Sildar are both speaking, standing over a table. At the side is Sister Garael, who holds a book of Tymora's teachings. Darren tells Sildar that they need to rally the townspeople to take out the leadership. Sha agrees out loud and the party is told about the two leaders.
	- Glasstaff, a caster who specializes in illusory magic and only communicates through missives but never leaves the manor.
	- Braxen, a powerful fighter who leaves the manor at night for revelry.
- Darren advises the party to check on Toblin to make sure he's okay. He also advises the party to be stealthy about the manor siege, as not doing so will alert the inn. Sildar says there's about 50-100 Redbrands total in the city. 
- Sha, Dravik, and Caiphene hear Sister Garael murmur something. She says there is something more pressing to address. 
- Sister Garael gives Caiphene visions of a forest out to the east. There is a castle in the middle of the woods. Sitting in the throne room of that castle, the same figure that spoke with Dravik last session (though Caiphene does not know her). The last image Caiphene sees is a screaming image of a banshee.
- Sister Garael explains that a few days ago she got a message from an acquaintance back east. She is part of a secret organization called the Harpers. She explains that she met the banshee Agatha when she was younger and made a deal. She tells Caiphene that her goddess has guided her to them. She gives Caiphene a long box with an artefact and Dravik sees the box for what it truly is: a drow-designed puzzle box. The symbols on it seem to tell a story.
- She tells Caiphene that if she can figure out how to open the box, she will be able to use it to appease the banshee. In her past life, she was a great diviner and knew many things. 
- The party decides to go to the inn. They find it boarded up and inaccessible. The party hammers at the boarded up door as they hear Toblin being accused of selling poison inside. Zinna blows a hole in the door. We fight the bandits and kill them. Sha is unconscious but stable.
