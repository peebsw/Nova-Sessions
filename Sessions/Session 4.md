Note: Day 3 of being in Phandalin
### Notes

-  [[Harbin Wester|Harbin]] confirms that the party is going to take care of the issue in the hills with [[Wendell]]. He tells them that the bandits that have been hiding out in the south have been attacking from their new base of operations, Wyvern Tor. He tells us to bring the head of Brughor to the receptionist. [[Dravik]] tells him they plan to bring the head to him directly, which makes [[Harbin Wester|Harbin]] recoil.
- [[Wendell]] gives out 150 gp to every member of the party, then the group heads to the south. They stop by the [[Halia Thornton|Miner's Exchange]], where [[Zinna]] goes off to one of the side forges to work on a magical item of her own. She positions herself at a workbench and, with a griffon feather and a metal item, creates a magical item with 2 charges.
- [[Corrin]] is at the reception area. Above, he hears some footsteps descending from upstairs. A woman ([[Halia Thornton]]) approaches with a dwarf at her side. They are negotiating in hushed tones. It is not [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]], but rather an unknown dwarf named [[Nundro Rockseeker]].  They make an agreement in negotiations and part way. [[Halia Thornton|Thornton]] approaches [[Corrin]] and greets him. She asks how long he's been in town and asks him about his purpose in town. [[Corrin]] informs them he is a blacksmith, and [[Halia Thornton|Thornton]] introduces him to ==[[Nundro Rockseeker]] ==. 
- [[Corrin]] tells [[Nundro Rockseeker|Nundro]] that they came on a job from [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]], and that they delivered the supplies to the warehouse owned by [[Elmar Barthen|Barthen]]. [[Corrin]] mentions their travel and the [[Redbrand]], which piques [[Halia Thornton|Thornton]]'s interest. [[Corrin]] gets the sense that she's well connected. [[Nundro Rockseeker|Nundro]] asks whether they fought off the [[Redbrand]], and whether [[Sildar Hallwinter|Sildar]] and [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]] were safe. [[Corrin]] confirms they disposed of the [[Redbrand]] save for one. [[Nundro Rockseeker|Nundro]] mentions that the town is going downhill; [[Halia Thornton|Halia]] invites [[Corrin]] for a drink upstairs and asks about the party.
- The party arrives then, as [[Halia Thornton|Halia]] leads [[Corrin]] upstairs. The receptionist asks the party to state their business. [[Dravik]] asks for [[Corrin]] and [[Zinna]], and the receptionist calls [[Halia Thornton|Halia]], who invites them upstairs. [[Halia Thornton|Halia]] gives them all a drink and expresses gratitude for the party saving [[Qelline Alderleaf]]. She explains that her and [[Qelline Alderleaf|Qelline]] are very close, she is the children's godmother. She has always worked at the [[Halia Thornton|Miner's Exchange]] and it is a family business. She wasn't born in [[Phandalin]], but she's developed a soft spot for everyone. 
- She asks the party to take care of the [[Redbrand]]. [[Caiphene]], [[Corrin]] and [[Wendell]] are for it, [[Dravik]] has more questions, [[Esha|Sha]] is questioning her authority. [[Corrin]] agrees that the [[Redbrand]] need to be taken care of and wants to think it over, but [[Halia Thornton|Halia]] expresses that the matter is too urgent to wait. She explains that [[Sildar Hallwinter|Sildar]] is already part of the resistance. She also explains that the [[Redbrand]] have two leaders ([[Vraxen de Vrait]] and [[Glasstaff]]) with two key bases in town:
	- The [[Grista Kettlecopp|Sleeping Giant Inn]]
		- [[Vraxen de Vrait|Vraxen]] and the [[Redbrand]] sleep there and take out their pent up aggressions on the people.
	- The Manor up on the hill
		- The other leader, [[Glasstaff]], resides there with the [[Redbrand]].
- She suggests kidnapping [[Glasstaff]] or taking him out. [[Esha|Sha]] asks about the bandits in the south. [[Halia Thornton|Halia]] corrects [[Esha|Sha]] that they are less bandits and more raiders -- orcs. She explains that while they are still relevant to the safety of the people, they are less pressing than the [[Redbrand]] threat. She muses that [[Harbin Wester|Harbin]] probably sent them that way to get the party out of his hair.
- She gives the party a sending stone so they can keep in communication. The party discusses whether or not they can trust [[Halia Thornton|Halia]]. [[Wendell]] vouches for her, but the party remains a bit wary. At the very least, they plan on getting the [[Redbrand]] taken care of. The party plans to go to [[Daran Edermath|Edermath]]'s orchard to find [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]] before they make any moves.
- It is known that [[Daran Edermath|Edermath]] is a supplier of alcohol for the town. The party sees [[Tharden Rockseeker]] (a third brother) and [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]] on the hill of [[Daran Edermath|Edermath Orchard]], having a dispute of some kind. A few of the party members hear the brothers arguing, [[Tharden Rockseeker|Tharden]] talks about claiming the Forge before it gets blocked by bureaucracy. [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]] tells [[Tharden Rockseeker|Tharden]] that [[Halia Thornton|Halia]] will want in on the forge, and that she has ears in every corner. 
- [[Corrin]] talks to the two, looking for advice on how to deal with the [[Redbrand]]. He sides with [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]], but tells [[Tharden Rockseeker|Tharden]] that they don't trust [[Halia Thornton|Halia]]'s political way of speaking. [[Tharden Rockseeker|Tharden]] and [[Gundren Rockseeker|Gundren]] tell him that the inn, [[Grista Kettlecopp|The Sleeping Giant]], is going to attack [[Toblen Stonehill|Stonehill Inn]] as it's competition. He doesn't know when, but he recommends that they go see [[Sildar Hallwinter|Sildar]], who is talking to [[Daran Edermath|Daran]].
- [[Daran Edermath|Daran]] and [[Sildar Hallwinter|Sildar]] are both speaking, standing over a table. At the side is [[Sister Garael]], who holds a book of [Tymora](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Tymora)'s teachings. [[Daran Edermath|Daran]] tells [[Sildar Hallwinter|Sildar]] that they need to rally the townspeople to take out the leadership. [[Esha|Sha]] agrees out loud and the party is told about the two leaders.
	- [[Glasstaff]], a caster who specializes in illusory magic and only communicates through missives but never leaves the manor.
	- [[Vraxen de Vrait]], a powerful fighter who leaves the manor at night for revelry.
- [[Daran Edermath|Daran]] advises the party to check on [[Toblen Stonehill|Toblen]] to make sure he's okay. He also advises the party to be stealthy about the manor siege, as not doing so will alert the inn. [[Sildar Hallwinter|Sildar]] says there's about 50-100 [[Redbrand]] total in the city. 
- [[Esha|Sha]], [[Dravik]], and [[Caiphene]] hear [[Sister Garael]] murmur something. She says there is something more pressing to address. 
- [[Sister Garael]] gives [[Caiphene]] visions of a forest out to the east. There is a castle in the middle of the woods. Sitting in the throne room of that castle, the same figure that spoke with [[Dravik]] last session (though [[Caiphene]] does not know her). The last image [[Caiphene]] sees is a screaming image of a [[Agatha|banshee]].
- [[Sister Garael]] explains that a few days ago she got a message from an acquaintance back east. She is part of a secret organization called the Harpers. She explains that she met the banshee [[Agatha]] when she was younger and made a deal. She tells [[Caiphene]] that her goddess has guided her to them. She gives [[Caiphene]] a long box with an artefact and [[Dravik]] sees the box for what it truly is: a drow-designed puzzle box. The symbols on it seem to tell a story.
- She tells [[Caiphene]] that if she can figure out how to open the box, she will be able to use it to appease the banshee. In her past life, she was a great diviner and knew many things. 
- The party decides to go to the inn. They find it boarded up and inaccessible. The party hammers at the boarded up door as they hear [[Toblen Stonehill|Toblen]] being accused of selling poison inside. [[Zinna]] blows a hole in the door. The party fights the bandits and kill them. [[Esha|Sha]] is unconscious but stable.
- With the [[Toblen Stonehill|Stonehill Inn]] situation resolved, we are left with checking out the [[Grista Kettlecopp|Sleeping Giant Inn]] and the manor on the hill.
