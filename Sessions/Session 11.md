- Caiphene is approached by Sister Garael, who was not a part of the fighting. She asks Caiphene how she's doing. Caiphene hands over the comb, to which Sister Garael says it was meant for Agatha, who still lingers in her hollow, northeast in Conyberry. She was a seer in her lifetime. She was a victim of her own foresight. Sister Garael isn't sure what still keeps her here.
- Sister Garael says the comb might bring up a memory of her mortal life, and it might stir up something kinder in Agatha if she is presented with it. Sister Garael says to think of a single question that will make a difference, if Caiphene is to ask Agatha something. 
- Caiphene overhears that the Harpers and the Lord's Alliance are gathering forces in the west, preparing an attack force on a lich that has come up in the area.
- Sha heads off for a drink at the Stonehill Inn. Dravik is at the burial sites, giving prayer to the 18 individuals who fell. Qelline suggests a funeral pyre for the next day. Dravik and Corrin go off to chop some wood to process their emotions.
- Raidoff comes and introduces himself. He says he is part of the circle of the forest, and his brothers followed Sylvanus. He tells him that brother Hargran saw them when he came upon the fallen griffin. He asks Wendell if he'd like to join their druid group, undergoing a small ritual to receive a blessing, to which Wendell happily agrees.
- They chant in Druidic, asking for Sylvanus to bless Wendell. Raidoth hands over a carving of a wooden leaf, on which there is a symbol of a stag. There is a magical energy that comes over him. He has acquired the title of Spring Warden within the enclave.
	- He acquires the druidcraft cantrip.
	- Knowledge of how to craft three simple potions:
		- 1 TBD
		- 2 TBD
		- 3 TBD
- Wendell expresses joy that they are all now friends. Raidoth asks him what brought him, and Wendell tells him about Sildar. Raidoth tells him about whispers they've been hearing, The Black Spider. Wendell tells him Dravik knows all about it, so he leads the elder druid to him.
- Dravik and Corrin are introduced to Raidoth.
- Raidoth explains: To the north, deep in the woods, there is a cave. Until lately, there have been some different clans of goblins that have lived peacefully. They hadn't been organized until recently, but they've grown more violent. They said they served the Black Spider, and mentioned a cave, a place where the veil between worlds is thin. The goblins serve the Black Spider who is holed up in a castle of sorts. 
- Dravik lies and says that the title of Black Spider is usually a transient one, assigned to any drow that settles in a place. Raidoth does not believe him, but Wendell does. Corrin picks up on the fact that Dravik is hiding something. 
- Wendell tells Raidoth that the party has found out that there is a relic that the Black Spider is looking for in the Old Owl Well. Raidoth tells them that is troubling, as it is immeasurably old. He says if the Black Spider finds the way into the old city, it could be of concern for the whole region at large. He doesn't know what the Black Spider is after, but the act of rallying the goblins makes him think they are forming an army. 
- Zinna shows Raidoth the note they found from the goblins they encountered earlier on. Klarg is a bugbear who runs a faction of goblins called the Cragmaws. Wendell sends Rowan off to seek out Gundren. Rowan does not find him, the only dwarf he finds is Nundro Rockseeker. They say that Gundren is allegedly staying at Edermath Orchard. Raidoth goes with Wendell to speak with Darren and investigate.
- Zinna goes to the Miner's Exchange to rent a forge. Any use of the forge will cost 3 gp. Zinna makes some special gloves and limestone in the forge. Zinna is making some gloves out of the troll hide to make wolverine gloves. 
-  At night, when the party returns to the house, Corrin calls Dravik over for a couple of questions. He promises no judgement, but insists on answers. Dravik explains that he was told to not make his association with Lolth obvious, as it holds a negative connotation.  
- Dravik counters that he is a male drow and therefore would not be privy to any sort of information. He only knows what he needs to do, and not the workings behind it. Corrin asks him what he needs to do, but Dravik argues it is just a hypothetical. Dravik agrees that he is a paladin and a follower of Lolth. He says he wants what everyone else wants; Corrin wants to get to the mountain, and Dravik wants the same thing. 
- Dravik says that the drow would rather the Forge be in the hands of "civilized people", rather than the hands of a lord, bandits, or a vaguely greedy dwarf. Corrin establishes that there is definitely some connection between Lolth and Gundren's disappearance, but Dravik denies that they have any connection. He claims that his task was just to make sure that the Forge was in the hands of someone civilized enough to create trade and crafting agreements in the future.
- Corrin infers that Dravik has no actual interest in creating trade pathways, nor any of his higher ups. It also becomes clear that Dravik is working for someone, and it's not necessarily Lolth. 
- Corrin asks Dravik who gave him the orders, as it's unlikely Lolth herself would do that. Dravik says he cannot get his orders from Lolth directly, so he gets his orders from a mouthpiece. 
- Sha comes in, giving Dravik a chance to retire and pray to Lolth. Wendell makes sure everyone is filled in before they go to bed.
- The party goes to Halia's house. Dravik asks about the people that lost their lives; Halia says most of the ones who died were merchants. Dravik says he wants to offer up 200 gp to help out the families that lost their loved ones. 
- Halia says she is going to look into who will inherit the tavern next. She also says she looked for the townmaster but he was nowhere to be found. She says she is going to have a meeting with the town elders to see what will be done with the future of the town. Dravik asks if Gundren will be there, and Halia says she suspects he will be.
- Halia asks them what their plans are, Wendell says they are going to defeat the Black Spider. The party decides they are going to go to Conyberry, on the way to the Old Owl Well. If the Black Spider is not there, the party plans to double back into the woods to investigate there.
- The party are given a couple of horses; Wendell says he will turn into a horse as well. Corrin gets some groceries for the house. The party does their shopping trip to get some supplies. 
- At some point in the evening before, Wendell asks around town about Gundren. He asks a bird, who says that Gundren has been taken in some direction vaguely north by non-dwarves. The party decides they will take a look around on the way out the next day.
- Dravik names his horse Ant. The party gets 4 horses, including Wendell as a horse. 
- First Day: the party finds a couple of wagon wheels and sees the Sword Mountains in the horizon. The trip goes smoothly. On night one, Corrin makes BBQ for the party.
- Second Day: The party has to go over a muddy region closer to a small river. They hear the sound of nocturnal creatures. Sha and Caiphene notice two owlbears curiously coming towards the camp, smelling the stew Corrin cooked up.
- Wendell greets the owlbears, while Sha stands close by in case they try anything. Dravik stealthily retrieves his dagger. Wendell gives them some dried meat in exchange for safety.
- Third Day: The party comes to a point where they have to climb over a canyon-like ridge. There is a bridge they have to walk over, as it used to be a trading route towards Conyberry. 
- Conyberry, many years ago, was a town that engaged in trade with the region, including the town of Tribor. However, there have been a couple of things that have prevented that, such as an earthquake that caused a massive landslide and a tribe of barbarians that destroyed the town of Conyberry, rampaging and pillaging and killing the residents. Now it lays in ruins, so it is moreso the ruins of Conyberry. 
- As they pass, they come across the body of a mountain lion, which has been torn apart by some kind of scavenger. Corrin deduces that there have been rumors in the past of a gnoll population in the region, and it looks like a group has come and eaten the mountain lion.
- The party crests a small hill and arrives in the afternoon to the ruins of Conyberry. Up further on the hill on the far side is a collapsed watchtower. To the right is the remains of the market square, with remnants of overturned market stalls. The party cannot shake the feeling that they are being watched.
